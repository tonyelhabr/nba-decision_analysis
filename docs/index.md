# Preface {-}

This book is a compilation of a series of posts that I wrote my first attempt at a website.
(The website was known as "numbersense".)
I have not expended any time in updating any of the theory that I discussed.
I have only edited the content to fix urls, spelling and grammar errors, etc.
(Even despite these efforts, one might still find some "logistical" errors
because I am the sole editor and, as a human, am prone to missing my own mistakes.)

This book by no means represents the breadth of analysis of which I am capable.
(In fact, the lack of statistical analysis demonstrated within may actually
do a disservice to my reputability as a data scientist/analyst.) Nonetheless,
I think this book is still worth publishing because the content is well researched
and well thought-out. Also, on a personal note, I think this will be interesting to 
review in the future when gauging how I have developed as an analyst over my career.
