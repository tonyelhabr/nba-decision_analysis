(The website was known as “Number (Non-)Sense”.) I have not modified any of the content, except for minor “logistical” edits, such as for urls, spelling and grammar errors, etc.1 (In addition, I’ve modified usage of the word “post” (and similar references that make more sense for websites) appropriately, such as by changing “post” to “chapter”. This book by no means represents the breadth of analysis of which I am capable. In fact, while updating the content for the E-book medium and skimming over my writing, the lack of statistical analysis that I demonstrate may actually do a disservice to my reputability as a data scientist/analyst. Nonetheless, I think this book is still worth publishing because the content is well researched and well thought-out. Also, on a personal note, I think this will be interesting to review in the future when gauging how I have developed as an analyst over my career. Even despite these efforts, I’m sure that there are still some logisitical errors that I have not caught.↩ "],

In this introductory write-up I summarize conclusions made by other researchers about the biggest questions that I (and probably many others) have about the NBA draft pick value. I plan to follow this peer review up with a step-by-step guide where I will go into detail explaining my methodology and discoveries in attempting to answer to these questions for myself.2 1.1 The Question(s) 1.1.1 The Basic Question To be clear, the primary (or “first”) question that I am looking to answer can be stated explicitly as follows: “How valuable are NBA draft picks?” Before attempting to answer this question, I think that we should acknowledge that the term “value” is relatively ambiguous. In fact, I would say that the interpretation of “value” can lead to a range of different answers. Thus, I should be clear in how I intend to interpret it. From my point of view, the answer to the question depends on whether wants to define a player’s value either in terms of basketball production or monetary cost.;3 Thus, on one extreme, one can reasonably come up with one answer that completely neglects cost in favor of pure basketball production. (This kind of answer would emphasize draft slots at which selected players have historically produced the most basketball-wise, such as those at the top of the first round)). On the other extreme, an answer that completely neglects basketball production in favor of raw cost considerations might also be deduced.4 I am interested in trying to determine the answer to the question of “value” in two ways. One answer that considers only basketball production (i.e. the first kind of answer that I have suggested). Another answer that discounts basketball production with monetary cost. 1.1.2 A Related (and Better) Question I am also looking to answer the (“second”) question: “Are higher picks more valuable than lower picks?” Although this may seem like a simple restatement of the first question, I argue that its answer is different. I think the answer to this second question MUST consider both basketball production and monetary cost simultaneously. Furthermore, it must also weigh the significance of each of these factors on a relative basis with respect to the rest of the draft slots. Perhaps this second question is better phrased as “At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”5 In comparison, I would say that the first question is posed on an absolute scale, and its answer does not necessarily provide ground-breaking insight. Put another way, in answering the first question, it is reasonable to expect (and, as we will see, can be shown) that both basketball production and cost are highest for the top picks and lower for later picks. 1.2 The Answer(s) In this section I summarize and draw similarities among the methodologies and findings made by six researchers. I have listed the researchers and their writings in order of publication date.6 1.2.1 Justin Kubatko In a 2009 article published at his website Basketball Reference (which is like the mecca for all NBA stats nerds like me)), Justin Kubatko concisely documents his use of win shares (WS) to measure “expected value” (EV). In specific, he tracks the WS accumulated throughout the entire careers of players drafted from 1977 to 1991 (because all players who had been drafted in that year range had retired by the time of his analysis) and employs linear regression with a logarithmic transformation (i.e. linear-log regression) to come up with a formula for EV—EV = 76.9 - 18.8 * log(pick). Moreover, he records WS earned in only the first four years of a player’s career (to account for the conventional length of rookie contracts under the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA)) for all players drafted from 1977 to 2005 (meaning that all players drafted in the last year of that range had the opportunity to play four years) to come up with another linear-log formula for EV—EV = 26.5 - 6.3 * log(pick). In summary, Kubatko clearly infers that the “value” to be gained from draft slots diminishes with increasing pick number. However, his take is solely phrased in terms of basketball production; he stops short of putting his results in terms of monetary units. In relation to the questions that I have posed, Kubatko’s formulas and tables gives an answer that considers only basketball-production to my first question of general NBA draft pick value. 1.2.2 Aaron Barzilai In a somewhat formal research article posted at 82games.com, Aaron Barzilai builds upon the work of Kubatko using data from 1980 to 2007. He analyzes production in terms of four different metrics–PER-minutes, player wins, WS, and estimated salary—and he looks at each metric over three different time periods—__career, first four years, and years with rookie team.7 Like Kubatko, Barzilai presents an answer to my first question of big-picture draft pick value in terms of basketball production. Furthermore, as can be inferred from the above graph, he also provides an answer to my second question regarding the cost-effectiveness of picks. 1.2.3 Arturo Galletti In a 2013 post, Arturo Galletti, one of the main contributors at Wages of Wins, provides some interesting visuals in describing his take on the subject. Without specifying exactly which years he drew data from, he uses wins produced (WP) to measure basketball value, translates WP to a monetary value using an estimate of \\(1.7 million per win, and finds the net monetary value by taking the difference of the monetary WP and the CBA’s rookie salary obligation for each draft slot. Following the precedent set by Kubatko and Barzilai, Galletti accounts for the typical length of the contracts of first-round picks by averaging all data over the __first four seasons__ after draft year. However, because he also considers the monetary obligations of these contracts under the CBA, which only applies to first-round picks, he only evaluates the top 30 picks. (Kubtako and Barzilai models all 60 picks because they do not attempt to contextualize the monetary value of picks and wins.) After applying a linear-log regression, Galletti finds __&quot;Value of Wins [\\) Million]”:__ -13.79 * ln(pick) + 52.785 and “Net Actual Value [$ Million]”: -8.991 * ln(pick) + 32.705. Galletti’s regression graph is shown below. In contextualizing Galletti’s findings with respect to my questions, it is evident that he answers my first question in both fashions for which I sought an answer—his “Avg Wins Per Pick” and “Net Actual Value” data sets give answers for value in terms of pure basketball production and basketball production discounted by cost. 1.2.4 Nate Silver Next, Nate Silver took a look at the issue ahead of the 2014 draft at his website FiveThirtyEight. Using data from 1985 through 2014 and extrapolating data for rookies from the 2012 to 2014), Silver makes formulation that is similar to that of Galletti. Like Galletti, he finds the “Net Profit” (the analogue of Galletti’s “Net Actual Value”) of first-round draft picks after translating wins to currency and discounting these values (which he calls “Net Value Produced at Free-Agent Market Rate”) by rookie salary obligations. However, unlike Galletti, Silver uses WS as his choice for evaluating basketball production, and he evaluates everything on a five-year basis.8 With his “Net Value Produced at Free-Agent Market Rate” and “Net Profit” data sets, Silver analysis provides answers to my first question in terms of pure basketball production and cost-discounted basketball production. 1.2.5 Saurabh Rane More recently, just ahead of the 2016 draft Saurabh Rane tackled the question of NBA draft pick value in a guest post in Nylon Calculus. Employing first-round data for the rookie classes from 1985 to 2012, he evaluates players with respect to their highest single-season __[value over replacement player][(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player)__ (VORP) over the course of their careers. His approach is arguably more granular than that of others, which makes it relatively distinct. He neglects money considerations entirely and classifies players into one of four quartiles —All-NBA First-Teamer (top 2.5%), All-Star (top 10%), rotation player, or bust—while looking at seven ranges of picks—first, early lottery (picks 2 and 3), early-mid lottery (picks 4 to 6), mid-late lottery ( picks 7 to 10), late lottery (picks 11 to 14), mid-late first (picks 15 to 22), and late-first (picks 23 to 30). ^[In classifying rookies into four tiers, his approach somewhat mirrors that of a 2015 FiveThirtyEight piece authored by Neil Pane and Zach Bradshaw in which they forecast that year’s draft prospects using applied statistics. However, although he doesn’t provide explicit values in tabular form or implicit ones in the form of an equation, Rane’s charts, on of which can be seen above, clearly answer my first question about the general relationship between value and draft pick in terms of on-court production. He verifies the deductions made by others (either empirically or mathematically) that the pure basketball production that can be expected of higher picks is much greater than that for lower picks, and that this drop-off is non-linear (for potential All-First Teamers and All-Stars). Put another way, he asserts that the chance of a player becoming elite (i.e. All-First Teamer or All-Star) is not linearly related to their draft position; rather, top picks have a much greater chance at becoming All-Stars or All-NBA First-Teamers. 1.2.6 Michael Lopez Writing even more recently than Rane is Michael Lopez, an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Skidmore College. He provides some input on the NBA in a broader analysis that compares the importance of draft picks in the four major American team sports. For the NBA draft specifically, he uses career WS and a locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing (LOESS) regression to model data from 1990 to 2005. Like Rane, he cannot provide a formula for the regression, as a consequence of using LOESS. Nevertheless, he finds that the relative value of late second-round picks is much less (about 20 times less) than that of top picks, which confirms the empirical notion of experts and the findings of other researchers that superstars dominate the NBA.9 In summary, Lopez’s research goes as far as Kubatko’s and Rane’s in its relevance to answering my questions—that is, it provides an answer to the big-picture question of value gained from draft picks, but only in terms of basketball production.10 1.2.7 The Aggregate Answer(s) At the very least, each of the six analysts I have mentioned here—Kubatko, Barzilai, Galletti, Silver, Rane, and Lopez—modeled the relationship between draft position and basketball production, providing one of the two types of answers to my first question regarding the general value of draft picks. Although they differed in their choices for metric for assessing basketball production (e.g. WS, VORP, etc.), sample size of data (i.e range of draft years), the time span for evaluating production (e.g. four years, career, etc.), and their methods for regression (e.g. linear-log, LOESS, etc.), they all came to the basically the same conclusion—that is, that players who are selected earlier are likely to outperform those selected later (which is precisely what a rational observer would hypothesize).11 Furthermore, Galletti and Silver go beyond simply measuring the value of draft slots in terms of basketball production and contextualize it in terms of monetary cost, which is what I sought in a second type of answer to my first question about big-picture NBA draft pick value. Nevertheless, n all cases studied, each researcher found the relationship between value and draft slot to have a decaying, non-linear characteristic. Finally, I should note that Barzilai provides an answer to my second question about the cost-effectiveness of picks. He shows that mid-first-round picks give the greatest “return on investment” relative to the rest of the top 30 picks. 1.3 Final Thoughts In my own take (which you can read in an upcoming post), I plan to draw inspiration mostly from Galletti and Silver because I want to do my best to evaluate the picks from a monetary perspective. However, I am intent on using a different methodology and providing some (slightly) different analysis.12 I plan to discuss some closely related topics as well.↩ Notably, one can even interpret basketball production and monetary cost in a number of different ways, although the former is typically evaluated in terms of an “all-in-one” advanced metric and the latter is typically evaluated in terms of salary obligations.↩ Such an answer would favor those slots where picks have historically received the least amount of money from contracts, such as those in the late in the second.↩ Admittedly, this re-phrasing isn’t something someone would say in normal conversation.↩ Consequently, answers to the questions that I have posed are not given in an outlined fashion.↩ Barzilai doesn’t analyze the third time period much in his discussion. After discarding the combination of estimated salary for the non-career time stints, he comes up with 10 data sets. He normalizes on a percentage basis relative to the top pick such that the units of the dependent-variable (i.e. the basketball-production metric) are eliminated. After taking an average of the seven data sets not involving time spent with rookie team, he comes up with an explicit formula for “relative value” (which I will abbreviate as RV)–RV: 0.947 exp(-0.05331 ^ (pick - 1)). Although Barzilai doesn’t directly contextualize his results in terms of money, he finds that the later picks are relatively undervalued when comparing a normalized curve for estimated value with a normalized curve for rookie salary obligations (dictated by the CBA).↩ Both of these are relatively minute differences.↩ Furthermore, aside from verifying the dramatic drop-off in on-court production with increasingly lower draft position, Lopez finds that the drop-off is more dramatic in the NBA than in the other three major American team sports. In other words, he shows that the top NBA picks are more valuable that the early picks in the drafts of other sports.↩ I do not mean to discredit Lopez (or Kubatko or Rane) for not supplying answers to all of my questions. I acknowledge that each author had unique intentions in their research. For example, Lopez was concerned with expected value in sports other than just the NBA.↩ The thinking behind the hypothesis that the production of players in the NBA (or any sport) correlates relatively closely with draft position is that players selected at higher slots demonstrate higher ability and potential to improve before being drafted, so they are more likely to succeed and add value to their teams. Lopez finds that this is true for each of the four major American sports For the NBA specifically, this correlation between on-court value and draft position has been verified in research looking at various lengths of time: Rane and Lopez evaluated value added over the length of players’ entire careers, Galletti and Silver solely considered the time spanning the length of players’ rookie contracts, and Kubatko and Barzilai looked at both of these periods of time.↩ For example, while Silver makes a rigorous effort to account for exceptions to the rule-of-thumb for rookie contracts, I think I will be happy to ignore these cases. To name one way in which I will differ from Galletti, I plan on using WS, not WP, for evaluating basketball production. Furthermore, while Silver uses his model to focus nearly exclusively on the value of the top pick, and Galletti hinges his analysis to evaluate the importance of draft picks for winning championships, I’m interested in a variety of issues. I will try to provide enough basis for further analysis by deriving several models, including one that I can leverage to either verify or deny Barzilai’s implication that picks in the teens are more cost-effective than those at the top and bottom of the first round.↩ "],
["what-research-says-about-nba-draft-pick-value-part-2.html", "2 What Research Says about NBA Draft Pick Value, Part 2 2.1 More Questions 2.2 More Answers 2.3 Final Thoughts", " 2 What Research Says about NBA Draft Pick Value, Part 2 Having asked and answered the biggest question(s) about the value of NBA draft picks in my last chapter, there are a couple more questions that I sought to have answered (and will attempt to answer myself in my upcoming step-by-step guide to estimating NBA draft pick value.) If you haven’t read that post, you should definitely check it out because I will reference some of the research discussed there in this chapter. 2.1 More Questions 2.1.1 The Third Question Picking up where I left off, I can articulate two other questions (i.e. “third” and “fourth” questions) that I sought to answer in my earlier review of existing research.13 In considering the meaning of “value” as I did before, I think answers for this question contextualized in terms of either basketball production or monetary cost are equally valid. Some general managers might be fascinated with the superstar potential of a particular prospect and, consequently, would be willing to give up other assets (e.g. experienced players, future picks, etc.) to move up in the draft and pick that talented player. On the other hand, some may be more concerned with cap considerations or trying to “beat the market” by moving into slots that are most “cost-effective”.14 2.1.2 The Fourth (and Final) Question Finally, the last question that I looked to answer (for now) is “Can tanking be justified?”15 Even though this fourth question does not explicitly include the word “value”, I believe that its answer is still dependent upon the word’s interpretation. In this context, it is probably easiest to interpret its answer on the basis of on-court basketball production, as opposed to off-court monetary cost. In particular, I think a reasonable analysis of the question might compare the chances of a team winning the championship against the likelihood of improving the team with a higher draft pick. In this case, it might be necessary to evaluate “value” on a relative scale because winning a championship is a binary variable (i.e win or no win), whereas the unit of measurement is different for cost (i.e. $ million for rookie contracts) ands for the researcher’s statistic(s) of choice for quantifying basketball production (e.g. an “all-in-one” metric like win shares (WS)). As you can see from this caveat-filled discussion (as well as the one in my last post) the term “value” is fairly ambiguous. Nevertheless, having defined it in a specific way for each question, I think we can now better contextualize the answers provided by existing research. 2.2 More Answers 2.2.1 The Third Answer My third question is answered directly in one of the articles I have already reviewed. Arturo Galletti translates his regressed “Net Actual Value” values (which he calls “Modeled Values”) to relative ones for the purpose of constructing a pick trade value chart. This chart is shown below. After inspecting Galletti’s regression formula and his numbers for “Modeled Value”, I found that he simply calculates the quotient of the values for any given two picks to come up with their relative trade value. However, I think it is better to use an alternative method that leverages the concept of indifference probability(IP) to calculate relative trade values (as I do in another write-up) where I first scale all the monetary values to a 0-to-1 unit-less basis before taking the quotient of any two values. I believe that my method for calculating relative values using IPs is superior because it does not result in negative values for second-round picks. In particular, if Galletti were to have expanded his chart to include all 60 picks, you would begin to see negative values for picks 38 and below when their values are calculated with respect to the top pick. Anyways, the following figure depicts how Galletti’s numbers would look for the top 10 picks using my proposed alternative method using IPs. Aside from Galletti, Nylon Calculus contributor Nick Restifo provides a trade value chart posted in a recent 2016 article at Fansided. Similar to Saurabh Rane, Restifo uses peak value over replacement player (VORP) values (although he averages over the combined best two-year VORP value rather than simply taking the best single-season value), and, like Michael Lopez, he runs a LOESS regression (although he keeps the raw value of the top pick). Although Restifo’s chart is not normalized like Galletti’s, the value of certain picks relative to one another can be interpreted by finding the absolute difference between the listed values of the picks of interest.16 Interestingly, after Restifo’s absolute VORP numbers are normalized to a unit-less 0-to-1 basis using the same alternative method that I used to re-calculate Galletti’s numbers, it turns out that his relative trade value numbers differ relatively dramatically from Galletti’s. The following figure mirrors the same idea shown in the previous figure for Galletti using the calculated relative values for Restifo. So whose numbers should be taken as truth? As it often seems to be in analytical discussion like this, the answer is “it depends” . We must realize that the two sets of normalized numbers are calculated in a different context—Restifo looks only at_ basketball production, while Galletti discounts on-court value by rookie wage scale cost. I can make an effort to account for this difference by using Galletti’s regressed “$ Value of Wins” formula estimating the monetary value of wins. Recognizing that this formula—although it is described in units of currency—correlates directly with Galletti’s basketball production “Avg Wins per Pick” data set, I can review how Galletti and Restifo stack up on an equal basis after normalizing these basketball production values with the regression formula that Galletti provides for his “\\(alue of Wins [\\) million]”. In doing so, I come up with numbers that describe the same idea—basketball production. Having back-tracked Galletti’s numbers to neglect cost, the only difference in the two basketball production estimates is that Galletti’s numbers are based on wins produced (WP), which is fairly similar to win shares (WS), while Restifo’s are based on peak VORP. The following figure shows Galletti’s trade value estimates for the top 10 picks calculated for his basketball production metric. So, even after accounting for Galletti’s slightly different method of calculating relative values, negating the cost factor incorporated into Galletti’s original numbers, and normalizing the Restifo’s VORP numbers, it still appears that Galletti’s and Restifo’s trade value estimates vary fairly noticeably. (In fact, it appears that their estimates differ even more now!) As I implied before, this difference arises purely from each writer’s choice of basketball-production metric. Thus, despite my efforts to account for differences in methodology between two researchers, I will leave this discussion at this point. All that is to be said is that the answer to my third question regarding relative trade value depends on your evaluation of the merit of a given advanced metric. 2.2.2 The Fourth (and Final) Answer Finally, as with my third question, an answer to my fourth question can be found in one of the articles I have already summarized. Rane leverages his estimates for draft pick value contextualized by likelihood of player outcome—All-NBA First-Teamer, All-Star, rotation player, or bust—and normalizes them on a percentage basis to estimate the expected value for a team BEFORE the final lottery spots are determined. The dashed and solid lines in his figure below depict the expected values before and after the teams drafting at each draft slot are finalized. Thus, by looking at Rane’s “prior” and “posterior” estimates, we can simulate the perspective of a team that is bound to miss the playoffs and might reasonably tank in order to improve its lottery odds. In comparing the two types of lines, Rane notes that tanking when one already has one of the bottom-three or bottom-four win-loss records is not beneficial, as is made evident by the flattening of the dashed curves for the All-NBA First-Teamer and All-Star for the very top draft slots.17 While Rane does not explicitly confirm that the converse is true—that tanking can be beneficial for losing teams that are below average but not egregiously bad—he implies that tanking is not justified for mid-lottery and low-lottery teams either. He notes that the relative indifference in odds of netting an elite player (i.e. All-NBA First-Teamer or All-Star) within the mid-lottery range of picks suggests that these picks aren’t actually as valuable as some pundits have suggested, with respect to producing superstar players. Rather, the linear rise of the rotation and bust lines in the mid-lottery range suggests that higher picks in this range only generate good baseline players (i.e. rotation players or busts) with increased likelihood.18 Rane’s conclusions are backed up by a Journal of Sports Economics study published earlier this year. (This study is concisely summarized by renown American writer Jonah Lehrer on his blog.)19 Published under the lead of Akira Motomura, the research paper concludes that a team’s general management and other intangible infrastructural influences (i.e. “team culture”) has a stronger influence on the success of a team than do the draft slot it earns and the players that they draft. In specific, Motomura et. al. find that picks 1 through 3 tend to have a relatively neutral impact on the near-future win-loss records of their respective teams, that picks 4 through 10 actually have a negative impact over the following years20 A number of factors can explain the conclusion that tanking lacks merit. For one, it is understandable that even the most talented rookies cannot make a huge impact and turn franchises around immediately because they tend to make many more mistakes than their veteran peers, who can make up for any age-induced talent diminishment with their experience and knowledge of the game’s ins-and-outs at the professional level. Veterans tend to garner more respect from referees than younger players, understand the tendencies of opponents after having played them numerous times, and know how to pace themselves in a manner such that they don’t wear down by end of the regular season. Even after young players move on from their rookie seasons, they often don’t mature and reach their full potential for another couple of years. Aside from the experience advantage that discounts the effect of young players, there is also the fact that picking players in the draft is an inexact science. Teams at the top of the draft often pick players that turn out to be busts. Although tanking can increase the probability of earning a high draft slot, the expected value of a pick is just that—an expectation. There is no guarantee that teams will select the best player for them. As Motomura et. al. argue, drafting players and player development are skills that derive from the foresight and teaching capabilities of the team’s management. Thus, a draft pick’s expected value is heavily influenced by the team that is selecting at that slot, which is not reflected in any publicly available draft pick value model of which I am aware.21 While the research of Rane and Motomura et. al. suggest that tanking is not justified, Arturo Gutierrez finds in his research article The NBA Lottery and Game Theory that there are cases that tanking can be the “correct strategy”. For his analysis, Gutierrez first formulates an estimate of draft pick value by running a polynomial regression over the career WS earned by players drafted by teams ordered by win-loss record.22 Then, he formulates an estimate for the likelihood of a team winning the championship by running a separate regression over the historical results of teams ranked by playoff seed, Next, he compares these regressed curves on a graph over a dependent axis with numbers counting from 1 to 30 in order to represent teams ordered by best win-loss record for any arbitrary season. Finally, after accounting for what he calls the “time value” of winning a championship (such that the values of his regressed curve for championship likelihood are boosted because chances of winning in the near future are added to the single-year values), Gutierrez outputs a graph that indicates that any team worse than the sixth-best team should purposely try to lose.23 I think that Gutierrez’s perspective on this matter suffers somewhat from its failure to consider mixed strategies and their equilibria. He considers only the pure strategies of expending all effort to be the best team or to be the worst team.24 Nevertheless, Gutierrez admits that there are limitations to his approach. He notes that the “best response” for a given team is dependent on its specific situation, including variable such as the team’s win-loss record and its perception of whether or not other teams are tanking. Thus, even though Gutierrez’s analysis offers some validity to tanking, I don’t think his evidence is sufficiently strong to override the case made by the research of Rane and Motomura et. al. 2.3 Final Thoughts In my first write-up I took look at the value of draft picks in terms of basketball production and contractual costs after reviewing the methodologies and conclusions of other researchers. There, I found that the answers were fairly the same across all researchers. Moreover, I reviewed only one person (Aaron Barzilai) who really evaluated the cost-effectiveness of picks, a topic which I also plan to explore. Now, having reviewed what research has to say about the related topics of pick trade value and tanking and having coming to some non-universal answers, I plan to expand my investigation to include these subjects as well. Actually, to be truthful, I only postulated these questions while looking for answers to my previous two questions. The third question can be simply stated as “What is the relative trade value of picks?”↩ I mentioned the term “cost-effective” in my previous chapter without formally defining it. In reality, economics terms such as “cost-effective”, “beating the market”, and “return on investment” should be formally defined in an NBA context by the person conducting the cost analysis. In any matter, I think that the reader can probably correctly infer the author’s intended meaning if the author neglects to define such terms. Thus, I am interested in trying to come up with the answers to the third question from both kinds of “value” perspectives—purely basketball production and purely monetary cost. In particular, I would say that the monetary interpretation is interesting for identifying general managers who have tried to “outsmart” their colleagues.↩ The term “tanking” refers to a team that intentionally loses to try to improve its odds of winning the NBA lottery. The 14 teams that miss the playoffs are entered into a lottery that determines draft order. The teams with the worst records have the best chances of winning a higher draft slot. More detail about the lottery can be found at the satirical NBA Tankathon website.↩ As an aside, one should realize that, even if the values of two lower picks is equal to that of a single higher one, one might reasonably prefer the higher upside presented by the higher draft pick, while someone else might prefer the “diversification” of having two prospects as opposed to one.↩ On the other hand, the final expected value of lottery picks between 5 and 14 generally is equal to (or greater than) before the finalized allocation of draft picks to teams.↩ On a related note, these trends reaffirm the raw conclusion that we made about the generalized draft pick value question—that basketball production drops off as pick number increases—and give a partial answer to my restated second question from before (“At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”) Using Rane’s illustrations, we can deduce that, in terms of pure basketball production, the value of mid-lottery and low-lottery picks are highly unlikely to generate elite players. Of course, the conclusions of others who have evaluated draft slots in terms of pure basketball production also implies the same principle, but Rane’s illustrations and rhetoric make this notion definitive.↩ I am thankful to Lehrer for his review of the study because I do not actually have access to the study.↩ Motomura et. al. find that these picks correlate to 6 to 9 more losses three years after the draft year, and that, more generally, all picks in the lottery range (and extending to pick 17) are associated with negative (or negligible at best) team performance. These numbers clearly suggest that tanking is not exactly the best strategy for teams looking to improve.↩ Accounting for how team factors correlate with the value extracted from draft picks would be a very difficult task that would require lots of probabilistic assumptions.↩ In contrast to the methods used by the researchers I discussed in my last chapter, he does not directly relate his choice of basketball production metric (in this case, WS) with draft slot; instead, he factors in the probabilistic relationship of lottery odds with team win loss-record to relate basketball production to teams ranked by record. Also, he uses a polynomial regression rather than a linear-log regression or a LOESS.↩ Without accounting for “time value”, then the intersection point manifests at the third-best team. This graph is shown in the figure below.↩ This perspective is like a manifestation of the idea that I described at the beginning of this chapter—evaluate tanking by comparing draft pick value and championship likelihood from a stict binary point of view.↩ "],

The answer is multifaceted. First, I’ve been a huge sports fan ever since I was a little kid, as I mentioned in a previous chapter about the origins of this website,. In particular, basketball is my favorite sport to play casually, and the NBA is probably my favorite professional league to follow.26 Second, since near the end of my time in college, I’ve learned a lot of the basics of topics such as game theory through online Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and some other less formal mediums. I was hungry to find a topic to which I could apply some of my new-found knowledge in a meaningful way. Third, despite the other research discussing the value of NBA picks, I still feel like this subject matter can be explored in more ways. Thus, being a huge fan of the NBA and realizing that the NBA draft can be analyzed from a variety of perspectives based upon the knowledge I have gathered from the things I have recently studied, the value NBA draft picks turned out to be an easy choice of topic to analyze. So why should you even read this if others have already written about in depth? First of all, I make references to economic theory and disciplines related to decision analysis when explaining terms. Secondly, and more importantly, I try to be as explicit as possible so that anyone can follow my methodology and adapt it to their liking if they want to investigate the matter themselves. I should note that, because it would have been foolish to have completely ignored all of the wonderful other research out there, some of my design choices may seem very similar to that of others. However, I assure you that I do my best to make my methodology unique where I think it is reasonable to differentiate from the example set by others. Also, as you can probably tell from my last two posts, my perspective on what__ “value”__ means is somewhat nuanced and different from others’ interpretation, so my answers to questions related to draft pick value in the NBA may, consequently, differ. 3.1 Which Drafts? To begin, I need to choose which and how many drafts from which to draw data. I will settle on using data from the 18 drafts between 1995 and 2012. I reasoned that this data set defines a historical sample size that is significant enough for me to draw reasonable conclusions.27 Although I certainly could have used more data to improve the empirical accuracy of my calculations, I did not want to spend a large amount of time in doing so because I believe there is significantly more to be gained in learning how analysis techniques might be applied in this context. Also, I do not necessarily enjoy data mining and munging, and I didn’t want to take any extra time to write some scripts to retrieve and format the extra data, although I am certainly capable of doing so. In reality, I simply downloaded comma separated value (csv) files and formatted the data to my liking in Excel. In particular, I chose the 1995 draft as the first one my sample because 1995 was the first year that a rookie wage scale for first-round draft picks was instituted, which makes it possible to model the expected rookie contracts for those drafted in the top 30 (without having to look up the actual contracts handed out for each player individually). I chose the 2012 draft as the last one in my sample because rookies from the 2012 draft have had the opportunity to play four seasons, which is the typical length of the contracts given to those drafted in the first round. 3.2 The Rookie Wage Scale A brief overview of how the Collective Bargaining Agreement CBA) structures the rookie contracts of first-round picks should be made. According to the CBA, NBA teams have full rights to their first-round pick for five years.28 The CBA specifies the salary number that teams pay a player drafted at a given slot in the first round. For example, the rookie scale for the 2012 draft class can be seen here. Although teams can sign their players to any number within an 80% to 120% range of the slot’s specific compensation obligations, the two sides almost always agree to the maximum allowable salary number (i.e. 120% of the nominal value) in practice. Teams are obligated to pay their first-round picks for the first two seasons, and then have options to resign them for their third and fourth years,. It should be noted that the teams have to decide whether to pick up these options before the players’ second and third years respectively. Then, after the picks have played four seasons, the team has the option to make a qualifying offer to the player for a fifth year, still abiding by the salary limitations imposed by the CBA. In reality, most first-round draft picks that do well in their first four seasons sign a new contract (without the salary restrictions dictated by the CBA) in restricted free agency after their fourth year in the league. (The player’s team has the right to match any contract to the player by another team, which is the reason for the “restricted” descriptor.)29 There are certainly exceptions to the general rule-of-thumb of first-round draft picks playing four seasons under a rookie contract. Top 30 rookies who do not play well may be released and never play more than two or three seasons under their original contract. However, it is very uncommon for teams to neglect the draft pick’s third-year option because they will have only had one season to evaluate the prospect at the time that they must make this decision. Presumptively, a first-draft pick demonstrates a sufficient amount of potential to persuade their team from deciding after only one year that they no longer want to keep the player on their roster.30 For similar reasons, it is uncommon for teams to neglect to pick up the player’s fourth-year option, although this scenario has a slightly greater chance of occurring because teams will have had two seasons to evaluate their prospects at the time of the decision.31 More rarely, there have been some first-round picks that take the fifth year qualifying option in order to become an unrestricted free agent in the following offseason and have the ability to sign with any team that they choose, perhaps because they have not enjoyed their time with their original team.32 As a technical note, I should let you know that there were only 29 NBA teams from 1995 to 2006 before a 30th franchise was added to the league. Consequently, there were only 29 picks in the first round before 2007, and only 58 total picks in the draft. Also, some drafts had one team that had to give up rights to a pick in these years due to violations, so some drafts only had 57 picks. However, the rookie wage scale has always accounted for the top 30 picks, dating back to 1995. Thus, some of the upcoming cost, value, and profit numbers are skewed because I don’t attempt to account for these nuances. 3.3 Calculating Cost Before discussing my method of dealing with player salaries, I have to give major props to Nate Silver, who makes an attempt to account for the exceptions that I have described (about the rule-of-thumb template for first-round rookie contracts) in his take on the value of NBA draft picks. This means that his results might be a bit more accurate than mine. (But hey, I’m not quite the number-crunching machine that Silver is, so don’t hold me to his standard!) Arturo Galletti doesn’t provide much detail about how he deals with this topic in his research but I think it’s safe to assume that he does something similar to what I have done here. Anyways, you can read more about the methodologies and results of Silver, Galletti, and others in another chapter I made on existing research concerning this general topic of NBA draft pick value. Now, for my analysis, I make the simplifying assumption that all top 30 picks receive the basic four-year, 120%-baseline rookie contract. As an example, the numbers for the 2012 first-round picks can be seen in Figure 1. Figure 1: Four-Year Cost of 2012 First-Round Draft Picks In the context of economic theory, we can think of these salaries as the costs for draft picks, which can be interpreted as assets. Moreover, in a game theory context, this cost is like a discount factor applied to a payoff in a 30-player, iterated non-zero sum game. The game is the draft, where the players are the teams, and the payoffs are the value earned from draft picks. (I will discuss this notion of “value” in detail in the next section.) In this case, I am applying a discount factor unique to each to draft slot instead of scaling payoffs on a multiplicative basis, as is done traditionally in games. Before moving on, let me take a quick pit stop and highlight an important caveat. Notice that I have only discussed first-round draft picks thus far. This is because the CBA does NOT determine how teams must pay their second round picks. This makes it difficult to model the value of second-round picks without rigorously scraping the web for details of their contracts, which aren’t always publicly available anyways. For this reason, my analysis in this chapter focuses only on top 30 picks. (Nevertheless, I plan to make an attempt to model the value of second-round picks in the future in order to investigate the relative trade value of picks.) 3.4 Defining Value With the question about how to quantify a player’s cost out of the way, now there is the question of how to measure a player’s value in terms of basketball production. From an economics perspective, this basketball value can be interpreted as the returns of an asset. However, because the term “value” is more intuitive in this context, I will use it instead of “returns” (although I may still use “returns” every so often). While determining cost by contract numbers is probably not very controversial, there is certainly some debate as to how determine the value of an individual player in the context of team sport. Should I use a conventional box score statistic like points? (Definitely not. This is way too naive.) Perhaps some combination of these kinds of stats? (This is a better idea than simply using one statistics, but it could still be better.) My answer is along that train of thought. My choice is to use an “all-in-one” metric called win shares (WS), which attempts to determine what its name implies—the value of an individual player in terms of team wins. WS has been used for years among analytical circles to measure the value of players, along with other all-in-one metrics such as player efficiency rating (PER) and value over replacement player (VORP). As proof of validity, several of the researchers that I discussed in a prior chapter use WS in their draft pick value models. Why choose WS over other all-in-one metrics? Without going into all the mundane details of how it is calculated or deep theoretical arguments about why it is the best all-in-one metric, the primary reason for this choice is simple—WS is contextualized on a seasonal basis, which lends itself to my analysis. On the other hand, most other advanced statistics are calculated per minute or per possession rate like most other advanced statistics. Instead, it. (I should note that there are methods for converting PER to a seasonal rate, but PER is typically not used in such a manner.) Also, WS can be easily found on many websites such as Basketball Reference, and using it prevents me from having to calculate my own metric. represented by WS with the cost represented by the player’s contract. In fact, Basketball Reference’s querying tool makes it relatively simple for me to find the four-year WS sums of players drafted in a given year.33 Anyways, I don’t think the integrity of the my analysis is compromised significantly, if at all, because I use four-year sums and averages consistently. Also, taking sums and averages is arguably more representative of how general managers set their expectations for rookies. Most general managers are probably not judging rookies on how they can immediately impact their teams in the first year or so after being drafted; instead, they are most likely evaluating prospects on the potential value and profit to be had over the course of a many years, even going beyond the first rookie contract. Alas, perhaps in the future I may take a more discrete look at cost, value, and profit for each of the four years following a draft and compare them to my current analysis, but I do not think it would cause me to come to significantly different conclusions.) Although I said I wasn’t going to go into detail about why WS might be the best all-in-one metric, I feel obliged to mention the biggest disadvantages of its most legitimate alternatives—PER and VORP. (I’m sorry to those fans of plus-minus, but there are just so many version of Plus-Minus—including as box plus-minus (BPM), adjusted plus-minus (APM), and regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM)–that I don’t even consider it here.) PER can be skewed significantly by small minute sample sizes, and it arguably does not capture the value defensive play very well. Although VORP is arguably the most predictive all-in-one statistic, it also suffers from the difficulty of being translated to a seasonal rate.34 In relation to utility theory, one could argue that the metric used to represent basketball value—in this case, WS—represents a player’s utility. (In relation to game theory, which incorporates the principles of utility theory, WS would represent a payoff, as mentioned before.) From a purely basketball perspective, this make sense. However, the reality is that the NBA is a business and players are not only valued by the quality of their play, but also the desirability of their contracts. Put another way, given two players who contribute equally on the court (and are equal in terms of other factors such as risk of injury, personality, etc.), general managers would choose the one with a cheaper contract. Thus, I do not think that we can simply judge a player’s utility by their WS (or some other all-in-one metric). Instead, we must discount the value. So how do I translate WS to a currency? My answer here is not as straightforward as my choice of WS is, but it isn’t too difficult either. I can simply (1) sum up team payroll data35 for a given year ^[for example, the team payrolls for 2012 can be seen [here](https://www.eskimo.com/~pbender/misc/salaries13.txt and (2) divide this number by the number of games played in the regular season.36 The result is an approximation for what I call “WS value” (WSV).37 I did this for each of the 21 seasons from 1995 to 2015.38 The results are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Single-Season WSVs for 1995 — 2015 Next, I simply averaged the three seasons’ WSs with a given starting season from the five years for which I am interested (i.e. 1995 to 2012). As a result, I came up with a average four-year WSV for each season from 1995 to 2012, which can be seen in Figure 3. Figure 3: Average Four-Year WSVs for 1995 — 2015 3.5 Profit: Value - Cost Using these WSV averaged over four years, I can calculate the WSV for the top 30 picks for each of the 18 drafts by multiplying their number of WS by the appropriate average four-year WSV. As a technical note, I refer to these values as “empirical” in order to differentiate them with my upcoming regressed and “theoretical” analysis.39 Similarly, I say “raw” to distinguish between averaged results that are calculated using “regressed” values. After coming up with a number for the returns (i.e. the basketball production in terms of WS) of the asset (i.e. the draft slot), I can determine the empirical “____profit____” of each draft pick by taking the difference of the empirical four-year WSV and the draft slot’s four-year cost. Here, the term “profit” is used just as it would be in an economic context.40 Anyways, (for those you who couldn’t care less about terminology) the un-averaged, single-season profits for each first-round draft slot in 2012 can be seen in Figure 4. Figure 4: Emperical Four-Year Profit of 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Figure 5 displays the average results from the five drafts from 1995 to 2012 in tabular form. Figure 6 shows the same data in the form of a chart. Having mentioned them before, I should note that Silver and Galletti come up with similar graphs. Also, Galletti has a chart similar to my Figure 5. Figure 5: Average Raw Empirical Four-Year Profit of 1995 — 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Figure 6: Average Raw Empirical Four-Year Profit of 1995 — 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Before drawing any conclusions, I must admit that the results of the calculations made so far appear a bit noisy. This is due to the relatively small sample size. That’s no problem! Regression is a real savior in situations like this. Figure 7 shows the results of a linear-log regression run on the average raw data.41 If you read a prior chapter discussing existing research on the topic of NBA draft pick value, you should remember that Kubatko and that Galletti used the same exact type of regression in their 2009 and 2013posts respectively. Figure 7: Average Regressed Empirical Four-Year The regression readily confirms what is implied by the raw data. That is, it is clear that higher draft picks result in greater value for the team, even after accounting for contracts. Thus, I have provided an answer to the “first” question (“How valuable are NBA draft picks?”)__ __that I posed in the already-mentioned prior post chapter. You might be wondering exactly how my regressions look. I have stated the empirical WS, WSV, and profit below. Avg Reg Emp 4-Yr Rd-1 WS [WS] = -5.41 * ln(pick) + 23.78 Avg Reg Emp 4-Yr Rd-1 WSV [$ million]: -7.729 * ln(pick) + 34.265 Avg Reg Emp 4-Yr Rd-1 Profit [$ million]: -2.990 * ln(pick) + 14.546 Although the WS line is not depicted in Figure 7, I show its equation here so that it may be compared to the Kubatko’s regression formula. Moreover, my WSV and profit equations can be compared directly to Galletti’s analogues. Kubatko’s EV [WS]: -6.3 * log(pick) + 26.5 Galletti’s Value of Wins [$ million]: -13.79 * ln(pick) + 52.785 Galletti’s Net Actual Value [$ million]: -8.991 * ln(pick) + 32.705 Although Kubatko’sequation resembles mine fairly closely, there seems to be a noticable difference between mine and Galletti’s. Nevertheless, do not let the numbers fool you! I can assure you that when each equation is graphed along with its equivalent, the curves practically overlap.42 In fact, if you use the concept of indifference probability (as I do in another chapter) to normalize the regressed values on a 0 to 1 unit-less basis, you will find that the calculated values are exactly equal! Stepping back from these technicalities, I should note that the non-linear, decaying behavior of the value and profit lines confirm the common knowledge that the best NBA players largely dictate the performance of their teams, regardless of their teammates. This is reason why many fans classify players as either instrumental “super-stars”, satisfactory “starters”, or plain-ol’ “role players”.) More often than not, higher drafts picks turn out to be better players and provide value that is not linearly related to the value of a lesser player. At this point, I have estimates for the average empirical four-year cost, value, and profit of players picked in the first round of the five drafts from 1995 to 2012 using the WS metric as my basis. (I also have regressed versions of empirical WS, WSV, cost, and profit, but they are not shown here.) I have shown that all first-round draft picks represent bargains in the sense that their basketball production contextualized in terms of currency exceeds their monetary cost, as determined by the salary obligations for the draft slots. Also, I have shown that the top picks are the most profitable. I know what you’re thinking: “That’s nothing new. Others have done that before.” Alright, you have a point. But here is where I start doing things differently.43 3.6 A Different Kind of Profit What if teams drafted ideally? That is, what if they picked the first team picked the best available rookie (in terms of WS), the next team selected the second-best rookie, etc.? If I re-order draft picks from a given year by WS instead of draft pick and make the same assumptions about contracts, how would that look? Figures 8 to 10 are analogues to Figures 4, 5, and 7 for this new “theoretical” analysis. 44 Figure 8: Theoretical Four-Year Profit of 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Figure 9: Average Raw Theoretical Four-Year Profit of 1995 — 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Figure 10: Average Raw Theoretical Four-Year Profit of 1995 — 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Obviously the integrity of the original WS data is somewhat compromised if players are re-ordered by WS. Players would have certainly performed differently if they had been drafted by different teams, meaning that they would have played with different coaches and teammates. However, modeling these changes would be fairly difficult. Anyways, I think the results that that I have found would not be much different from what we would observe if draft picks were made in an ideal manner. So what does theoretical profit mean in a non-basketball context? From the perspective of the disciplines such as economic or game theory, one can interpret it as the result of every team having perfect information. Conversely, we might say that empirical profit represents the results of every team not having perfect information available to them. 3.7 The End (for Now) For now, I will leave the subject of NBA draft pick value here. I did a lot here—I have calculated estimates for the average raw and regressed empirical and theoretical WS, cost, value, and profit of NBA players drafted from 1995 to 2012. In doing so, I have essentially provided my own answer to my “first” big-picture question about the value of NBA draft picks. (Because I will never tire from linking the reader to my other relevant content, I oblige you to read my post discussing answers to my “first” and “second” questions provided by other researchers, as well as my follow-up post discussing peer answers to my “third” and “fourth” questions.) However, there is still so much more analysis that can be done, including some that can refine what I discussed here. Anyways, I plan to use the data sets developed in this chapter a basis for more analysis. Microsoft Excel is my software tool that I use here. R and python are wonderful alternatives with which I have gained experience recently, but, for now, I am most comfortable with Excel, especially when it comes to plotting and formatting.↩ Of course, you could probably guess that my favorite is the Spurs. Nevertheless, the beauty of the NBA is that it’s play is defined more so by great individual players than by teams themselves, so great players make their teams entertaining to watch. Thus, I think I can say that I enjoy watching any team on any given night. Moreover, I’m not a Spurs “fanatic” in the traditional sense of the word. As a wannabe analyst, I try to be as neutral as possible when observing teams.↩ All draft data was extracted from Basketball Reference.↩ An overview of the 2011 CBA provided by salary cap guru Larry Coon can be found here.↩ Consequently, the revenue earned by top 30 picks becomes highly variable after the fourth year of their rookie deals. It would be difficult to track post-rookie contract numbers for the purpose of the project. Similarly, it is difficult to verify that the contracts of top 30 picks follow the general contract template having four-year length with 120% of nominal compensation. These two issues could be addressed by some nifty web scraping scripts. However, as I mentioned before, I wasn’t analysis.↩ Joe Alexander sounds more like an accountant’s name than a high-flying potential lottery pick, am I right?↩ In retrospect, picking Jonny Flynn over Stephen Curry may not have been the most astute of decisions.↩ Unfortunately for him, Greg Monroe’s decision to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks doesn’t look like it has turned out so great.↩ If you’re wondering why I use four-year sums instead of the WS for individual seasons, it is because it requires much more work to do so. Using Basketball Reference as a resource, I would have to extract annual WS values for each player from each of their individual career stats pages. I’m not sure if there is a better or easier way of doing this other than writing a script to scrape all the data. In retrospect, I certainly could have written these kinds of scripts fairly easy, but I did not think of it at the time of starting all of my analysis. This would have also allowed me to get exact data regarding contracts. Nevertheless, having exact contract information regarding first-round rookies is arguably not necessary because general managers probably expect that the typical application of the rookie wage scale, so I don’t think it’s a good idea to try to account for exceptions to the general rule-of-thumb—such as major busts or very early retirement—in our models. On the other hand, the empirical salary data for second-round picks would be extremely helpful for evaluating the cost and value of second-round picks without having to make huge assumptions. It would allow me to expand my look at the draft in a manner such that the relative desirability of first-round picks would be better encapsulated because the last pick in the first round would not have to serve as a “baseline” measurement.↩ Having lightly criticized PER and VORP, I must admit that one downside of WS is that players on good teams tend to have over-inflated WS because those teams win more often and, figuratively, have more wins to attribute to its players. Nevertheless, because the highest-picked, more talented rookies tend to be picked by worse teams, this WS bias is not too troublesome for this analysis. If anything, this bias causes the results to be regularized because the potentially grandiose and miniscule effects of higher and lower picks respectively may be offset by the talent of their teams.↩ credit to Patricia Bender for collecting the data at her website↩ 1230 for a typical 82-game season with 32 teams, 1189 for seasons before the 2007 expansion when there were only 29 teams, 725 for the lockout-shortened 1999 season, and 990 for the lockout-shortened 2011 season↩ I could be more granular here by dividing each team’s win total in a given season by its team payroll for that season to get a team-specific WSV for each season. However, I don’t think the results would differ noticeably.↩ Galletti uses a similar method for translating WP to a monetary value, and Silver uses the figure $1.75 million for his calculations.↩ I always use the descriptor “theoretical” for cost even with my analysis of empirical WS because I do not use actual contract numbers. Instead, I use the projected cost numbers outlined by the rookie wage scale and its general application, as discussed before.↩ As a reminder, I am using the everyday term “value” in my writing, or the basketball metric WSV in my analysis, to represent the economic concept “returns”. On the other hand, my use of “cost” aligns with its intuitive and economic meanings. With respect to the term “profit” In the context of utility or game theory, one might say that it can also be interpreted as a “utility”. However, to be consistent with the economic context that I have applied up to this point, I will use primarily use the term “profit”. Also, I just think it is more distinctive than the term “utility”.↩ Here, the “Rd-1” descriptor is to added note that the regression is run only on first-round data.(As I hinted to before, I hope to analyze second-round data by making specific assumptions when modeling second-round rookie contracts in the future.↩ I might add those graphs here at a later time as proof, but I have chosen not to do so for now.↩ As a note to the reader, given how much stuff I have covered so far, this might seem like a natural breaking point at which to end this part of the analysis and continue in a separate part. However, because the “theoretical” analysis so closely follows the empirical analysis done up to this point, I have chosen not to do so.↩ As a technical note, in this analysis I looked at all drafted players for a given year and simply sorted them by descending WS. I did not consider un-drafted players.↩ "],

I begin with an isolated overview of some relevant decision analysis terms before discussing how they can be applied to better understand the NBA draft. 4.1 Some Theory VOPI, or value of clairvoyance (VOC), is a decision-maker’s indifferent buying price of perfect information.45 The CE of an option is the quantity (typically stated as a monetary value) that a decision-maker can be guaranteed and feel indifferent between receiving this quantity or choosing its alternative with some uncertainty of receiving its quantifiable return value. Put another way, given three options, a CE is the quantity that would make the decision-maker indifferent to receiving the middling option (i.e the option with a level of preference between that of the other two options) for certain or entering a dual-outcome game of chance in which there is some well-defined probability between 0 and 1—known as indifference probability (IP)–of receiving the more preferable option and its payoff, and the remaining probability of the less preferable option and the quantity associated with it.46 Having defined CE, we can now define the delta principle. We say that a decision-maker abides by the delta principle if his CE is independent of his existing wealth. To better understand the delta principle, we should try to contextualize the relationship—CE independent of wealth—that needs to be made for the principle to be true. For example, a very poor person—having very little to lose in the first place—is probably willing to give up a lot for a very small chance at earning a little. Consequently, we can say that the delta principle does not apply to poor people.47 Looking at the delta principle in another way, we can say that a decision-maker follows the delta principle if his buying and selling prices for any given lottery are equivalent. Anyways, no matter the manner one chooses to understand these ideas, the primary implication of the delta principle (in conjunction with CE and IP) is that a decision-maker’s utility function can be modeled as a linear or exponential. Without going into detail about utility function, suffice it to say that this result is extremely important for simplifying calculations involving risk and decisions. Returning to the discussion of VOC, if we make the assumption that a decision-maker follows the delta principle, then we can also define VOC as the difference WITH free perfect information and the value WITHOUT free perfect information. In this definition you should be careful to observe that, even though the possession of information is negated when going from the first to second statement, the object of possession—perfect information—is assumed to be free in BOTH cases. Thus, we should note that VOC is not just the difference of the values with and without perfect information; instead, it is the value difference with and without FREE perfect information. 4.2 Contextualizing VOC If you recall, time I concluded my guide to estimating NBA draft pick value with regressed curves for the average four-year empirical and theoretical profits for first-round picks in the NBA draft using WS and rookie wage scale data from 1995 to 2012. So how can we incorporate the concept of VOC to provide a unique perspective on this information? If I take the mathematical difference of the regressed theoretical and empirical profit data sets, I can find the VOC for each top 30 draft pick in terms of win shares (WS), win shares values (WSV), and profit. (Note that the VOC of cost cannot be found without having the “empirical” cost of each player.) One should interpret the theoretical curve as the profit of each draft slot if all teams have perfect information available to them and pick the best possible player. By “best possible player” I mean the remaining player with the highest number of actual WS earned after four years of those players not already selected at a given point in a hypothetical draft where teams drafty ideally.48 Figures 1 and 2 show VOC in tabular and graphical form for the WS and profits points calculated after regressing over only the first-round empirical and theoretical data. ((As a technical note, I should make the reader aware that the WSV VOC is simply equivalent to the sum of the theoretical cost and the profit VOC for a given draft slot. Thus, I have chosen not to show it for the sake of making the visualizations more compact.49 Figure 1: Average Raw and Regressed First-Round WS andProfit VOC Figure 2: Average Raw and Regressed First-Round WS and Profit VOC Just like the regressed curves for empirical and theoretical profits, the VOC curves for WS and profit exhibit diminishing returns. (The same can be shown for WSV VOC.) 4.3 Interpreting VOC Let’s consider the profit VOC curve exclusively for now. Interestingly, its values become negative at pick 20. However, decision-making theory dictates that VOC can never be negative. So does that mean that our VOC curves are invalid? (Maybe.) How should we interpret the negative VOC that we have calculated? I would say that the point at which the profit VOC curve in Figure 2 begins to take on negative values marks the tipping point at which knowing and picking the best player available no longer represents a team’s best option. Given that all teams are stripped of the opportunity of receiving perfect information if a single team does not receive it, then the team that drafts at the 20th slot and the teams that follow it (assuming that they do not also hold one of the earlier draft slots) are better off if they deny the perfect information. In other words, the teams making their first selection in the bottom third of the first round would prefer to conduct a traditional draft rather than having some kind of providential foresight that provides all teams league-wide with list of the best prospects ordered by WS to be earned in their first four years. Perhaps you believe this analysis is incorrect. I shall try to prove otherwise. To do this, let’s step back for a second and try to interpret the negative VOC from a more abstract, non-NBA perspective. 4.4 Criteria for Value-Adding Information There are four criteria necessary for information to add value. It must be observable and comprehensible. It must be related to prior beliefs in a probabilistic (i.e. Bayesian) manner such that these prior beliefs must be updated when given new information. It must enhance the belief about the utility of some choice to the extent that a different decision is made. It must not cost more than the value that it provides. Typically, one would only consider these criteria only in cases where imperfect information may be provided. Intuitively, perfect information can never provide destructive value (i.e. it can only provide additional or, at worst, no value), so one would never turn down the opportunity to acquire it, assuming that it is free. In comparison, information is not useful if it violates any of the criteria described above. ((Nevertheless, this does not mean that imperfect information is always not useful.50 The third criterion for value-adding information is arguably the most difficult to achieve. Even if information strengthens the appeal of one or more choices that were not previously considered optimal, it may not provide sufficient evidence to boost the utility of alternatives and validate a change of decision. The bottom line is that having perfect information is not useful when the VOC is equal to zero. 4.5 (Re)Interpreting VOC Now let’s revisit our discussion of the validity of the profit VOC curve that I have come up with. Did I do something wrong? The truth is this—I’m not really sure. Perhaps if I gathered more draft data, I would find that the regressed empirical profit curve drops off more dramatically (or that the theoretical profit curve diminishes at a slower rate) such that the resultant VOC curve is always positive. Moreover, if we look at the criteria for value-adding information from a literal perspective, we still don’t come to a definitive answer. It should be relatively clear that the first two criteria are met. In regards to the third criterion, the only reason that perfect information would not inspire a change of decision would be if the team’s choice of player without perfect information aligns exactly with whom hindsight determines is the best player. Although sometimes the top pick truly does prove to be the best player selected from a particular draft (in terms of WS), the reality is that it is highly unlikely that players selected after the top spot to be chosen in order of descending WS. This is easy to reason in consideration of the difficulty of predicting player talent, the uncertainty of team fit, and a number of other variables related to human interaction. Thus, I would say that it is fairly safe to assume that perfect information revealing which players will turn out to be the best meets the criterion of being sufficiently significant to instigate a decision change. Now, what about the fourth criterion for value-adding information? At first glance, it seems to be irrelevant. If I assume that the perfect information is provided free of charge, then how can its cost exceed its value? In response, I would argue that it should be interpreted in a slightly different way. I would say that, in this context, cost should NOT be interpreted as a monetary value. Instead, I think it more closely symbolizes an abstract opportunity cost. In reference to Figure 2, this means that the transition from positive to negative VOC values represents the point at which teams drafting beyond that point would rather hold a traditional draft, where no one has perfect information, as opposed to one where every team has perfect information. Again, you may wonder how this can be true. My rationale is this—teams with later picks often look to maximize their opportunity by picking a highly variable player who could just as easily become a star as he might prove to be a bust. Even those teams that are picking towards the bottom of the first round—presumably because they made the playoffs and have a significant amount of talent on their rosters already—and are more likely to feel that they only need a small amount of help to make themselves into championship-caliber teams will often pick high-ceiling, low-floor kinds of prospects over rookies whose talent level is more easily judged. This is because even those rookies who are more likely to be trusted (i..e. those projected to have low ceilings but high floors) are likely to be inconsistent and cannot be counted on to make significant contributions immediately. Conversely, my interpretation of the positive VOC values before the 20th pick is that teams with earlier picks would prefer to know who the best remaining player is, even if the teams before them also are given the same information. In other words, for those teams drafting in the top two-thirds of the first round, a hypothetical draft in which every team knows the true basketball production that each prospect will eventually provide and picks in accordance with this knowledge is better than the alternative—a non-hypothetical draft where teams can only estimate value with pre-draft evaluations. Interestingly, we can deduce that such a “theoretical” draft is preferable for those teams making top 20 selection even though it eliminates the potential for these teams to pick a player who may greatly exceed the historical expectations of the slot at which he is picked. 4.6 Game Theory and VOC The VOC concept might also be understood from a game theory point of view. We can think of the first round of the NBA draft as a game with multiple players vying to maximize their payoffs. The players are the teams and the payoffs are the profits of each draft pick. What kind of strategy should each team employ? In this context, one can interpret a draft with no perfect information (i.e. a traditional draft) as a sequential, extensive-form game with uncertainty at each move. Put another way, it can be modeled as decision tree with a decision node for each draft slot (and its corresponding team) and an accompanying chance node (or uncertainty node) with a probability specifying the team’s’ prior beliefs about the talent level of each prospect available at that slot. In this case, an expectimax strategy would be ideal. On the other hand, if every team were given perfect information about draft prospects, then the chance nodes would be eliminated, and a minimax strategy would be more optimal. ((In the context, of decision theory, “expectimax” is just another way of applying the more traditional term “minimax” in a situation where there is uncertainty. The term “expectimax” is used more commonly in relation to artificial intelligence (AI) search algorithms, but I choose to use it here for the purpose of being concise. 4.7 Conclusion Probably much more can be said on the relationship between concepts in game theory and decision analysis than I have discussed here, but I will leave it at that for now. In the future I may discuss principles in each discipline in the context of the NBA draft as I have done in this chapter with VOC. Anyways, that’s it for now. A word about notation—even though VOPI is more commonly used, I like the word “clairvoyance”, so I tend to use VOC in place of VOPI. Moreover, you might find that VOPI is sometimes abbreviated as VPI or referred to as expected value of perfect information (EVPI) instead. Also, in cases where imperfect information cannot be defined or is not considered, VOPI might be restated as value of information (VOI). Anyways, all of these terms and abbreviations refer to the same concept. A related principle (that must be defined for the purpose of this conversation) in the field of decision analysis (DA) are certain equivalent (CE) and the delta principle.↩ I plan to investigate IPs and their application more in a future write-up.↩ A similar argument can be made for very rich people.↩ This is just a different way of describing my “theoretical” values.↩ As a technical note, I should make the reader aware that the WSV VOC is simply equivalent to the sum of the theoretical cost and the profit VOC for a given draft slot. Thus, I have chosen not to show it for the sake of making the visualizations more compact.↩ Nevertheless, this does not mean that imperfect information is always not useful. (Here, I use “useful” to indicate whether or not the information adds value.)↩ "],
["indifferent-probability-and-the-nba-draft.html", "5 Indifferent Probability and the NBA Draft 5.1 Indifferent Probability, in Theory 5.2 Indifferent Probability for (First-Round) NBA Draft Picks 5.3 To Be Continued", " 5 Indifferent Probability and the NBA Draft The value of NBA draft picks relative to can be calculated using the concept of indifferent probability (IP), a term I briefly referenced in a previous chapter highlighting the value of information in the context of the NBA draft. I believe that IPs can be used to extend my analysis in another chapter covering how to estimate the value of NBA draft picks. Specifically, we might use them to learn about which picks are most cost-effective and what the trade value of picks is (in terms of other picks). In other words, I can find an answer to the second question “At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”) that I posed in my review of existing research on the topic of NBA draft pick value, as well as answer to the first question (“What is the relative trade value of picks?”) that I asked in its[follow-up chapter; However, just as I did in my post discussing the value of perfect information and the NBA draft, let me first provide a quick overview IPs in a theoretical context. 5.1 Indifferent Probability, in Theory For those of you who are not as familiar with utility theory or decision analysis, IPs are simply relative probabilities that define the degree of preference with respect to (usually) two other outcomes—one more—desirable and one less desirable. IPs are relatively straightforward to calculate. An IP is just the ratio of the difference between a given value and a pre-defined minimum value with the difference of a pre-defined maximum value with the same minimum value. Less formally, it can be written (given value - min value) / (max value - min value). In reality, we can calculate IPs with respect to any two points in a data set as long as the value of interest is not be greater than the maximum value or less than the minimum value. A better understanding of IPs is perhaps best acquired through an example. To stay within the realm of the sports before considering the application of IPs to NBA draft pick value, let us imagine a typical sports fan who has the autograph of his favorite player on his favorite team. Now, let’s say he has the option to play a dual-outcome game of chance in exchange for giving up his autographed item. If he wins, then he is granted the opportunity to spend an entire day with his favorite player; if he loses, then he receives nothing. Clearly, the first outcome is preferable to the second. Furthermore, the existing state of possessing the autographed item is less preferable to the first and more preferable to the second. The IP is the likelihood of winning the game (states as a probability) that would make the sports fan feel comfortable with (or, more precisely, indifferent to) giving up his autographed item and playing the game. If we imagine that the fan perceives the first outcome—the opportunity to spend a day with his favorite player—to be only slightly more preferable to the existing state—possessing the autograph—then his IP would be relatively high (e.g. ~0.75 to 1 probability, or ~75% to 100% percent chance). Similarly, the IP would be relatively high if the fan perceives the second outcome—receiving nothing—is significantly less preferable to the existing state. Intuitively, this should make sense: assuming that the prior two statements are true, then the fan would have to know that there is a high probability of winning the game of chance because he would strongly despise the outcome if he were to lose and only receive a relatively slight bit of enjoyment if he were to win. (Note that a high IP only necessitates that only one of the prior two statements is true, although its numerical value increases even more if both statements are valid.) 5.2 Indifferent Probability for (First-Round) NBA Draft Picks With this higher-level discussion of IPs out of the way, let’s take another look at our prior our estimates of the cost, value, and profit of first-round NBA draft picks. For reference, in Figure 1 and 2 I have reproduced the empirical and theoretical raw and regressed data sets shown in figures in my chapter on general NBA draft pick value. Figure 1: Average Regressed Empirical Four-Year Profit of 1995 — 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Figure 2: Average Regressed Empirical Four-Year Profit of 1995 — 2012 First-Round Draft Picks Next, Figure 3 shows the results for IPs calculated with respect to the maximum and minimum data points in four sets of win shares values (WSVs): (1) raw empirical, (2) raw theoretical, (3) regressed empirical, and (4) regressed theoretical. Figure 3: Average Four-Year First-Round WSV IPs If we use the highest and lowest values in a given range of points as our maximum and minimum points, we can actually calculate 16 different sets of 30 IPs (with one point for each of the 30 first-round picks in each data set).51 Where does the number 16 come from? I have four data sets for first-round picks: (1) WS, (2) WSV, (3) cost, and (4) profit. Also, we can permute each data set over two options of two variations: (1) empirical or theoretical data; (2) raw or regressed data. Basically, it comes down to four times two squared. Put even less formally, 16 IP sets: 4 data sets * (2 variations) ^ (2 options)).52 In you work out the math for all 16 IPs, you will find that the IPs for WS and WSV are nearly identical to one another for both the raw empirical and theoretical data. (Intuitively, this makes sense because WSV is just a scaled version of WS, and IPs are simply relative probabilities.) Furthermore, the four regressed forms of empirical and theoretical variations of data are completely coherent (i.e. exactly identical to one another). Thus, there are really only 10 unique sets of IPs. Four of these are shown in Figure 1 (i.e. the raw and regressed empirical and theoretical WS IPs). Not shown are the six other unique sets of IPs: two sets for raw empirical and theoretical WSVs, two sets for raw empirical and theoretical WSVs, and two sets for raw empirical and theoretical profit. (Recall that the regressed forms of these six sets are exactly equivalent to the two sets regressed WSV IPs shown in Figure 3.) So what if I lied when I said there were 16 different IP sets. 5.2.1 Return on Investment (ROI) Before doing some interesting analysis with our calculated IPs, I want to review some of our data regarding value, cost, and profit in order to better contextualize my upcoming look on market inefficiencies. If I may go back to using economics terminology for a moment, I can formally prove the notion of diminishing returns that was implied by the profit curves that we saw before. We can calculate return on investment (ROI), which is just the quotient of the profit and the cost, to verify that higher picks are the most cost-effective. Figure 4 depicts the ROI found using the raw and regressed theoretical four-year profits, as well as the raw theoretical four-year costs.53 Figure 4: Average Theoretical Four-Year WSV to Cost Ratios (ROI) The decaying behavior of ROI is not all too surprising, given our prior conclusion that top picks are coveted because top-level talent, which is most commonly acquired through high first-round draft picks, is extremely significant in the NBA, perhaps more so than in any other team sport league. My point is to show that top-picks are the most cost-effective. 5.2.2 Market Inefficiency So maybe the ROI concept seems like nothing new to you. You’re right, it really isn’t—it’s just a different way of contextualizing what we have already seen. Nevertheless, I thought it was important to introduce it in order to better understand how we can relate the term “market inefficiency” to our discussion. In particular, I am using the term to distinguish a pick from which the profit exceeds the cost correlated with that pick, relative to the rest of the picks. The key word to recognize here is “relative”. Although ROI proves that the top picks are the most cost-effective, it does so in an absolute sense. That is, it doesn’t really distinguish whether or not the profit produced at a particular draft slot is greater than what is expected by the rookie wage scale. This is where IPs come back into play—they can be used to identify market inefficiencies. In specific, if I take the difference of the IPs for WSV and the theoretical four-year cost, then I can pinpoint draft slots where player production outperforms that which is dictated by cost. But which of the four sets of WSV IPs should I use? For the sake of argument, let’s neglect the empirical WSVs for right now. I can argue that the set of raw empirical WSVs (the data set with the largest standard deviation for each point) are somewhat arbitrary and are biased by the drafting team and chosen player. Consequently, the regressed empirical WSVs are smoothed out too strongly by my linear-log regression to make this data set significant judgement in this nuanced analysis. That leaves us with the raw and regressed theoretical WSV IPs with which to compare to the theoretical cost IPs. I think that it is difficult to make a convincing judgement call between these two. On one hand, the significance of the raw theoretical WSVs is hindered somewhat by its derivation from empirical values. They are simply a re-ordering onfthe non-linear, non-Guassian distribution of empirical WSV, so they are also somewhat random. On the other hand, the regressed theoretical WSV set may eliminate the effect of reality to too great of an extent.54 Why not leave our judgement until we see how each stacks up in tabular and graphical form? Figure 5 shows __both theoretica__l WSV data sets, along with the cost IPs. Because it is somewhat difficult to see where the curves differ the most on their descents, I have also graphed the differentials of the IPs in Figure 6. Also, in case in you were wondering how the empirical WSV points look, Figure 7 is the analogue of Figure 6 with the empirical WSV sets (that I said should be neglected) instead of their theoretical counterparts. The market inefficiencies can be defined in Figure 5 as the areas along horizontal axis where the cost curve lies above the WSV curve. Likewise, these points of interests are the positive values in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 5: Average Theoretical Four-Year First-Round WSV and Cost IPs Figure 6: Average Theoretical Four-Year First-Round WSV to Cost IP Differentials Figure 7: Average Emperical Four-Year First-Round WSV to Cost IP Differentials I think the inconsistency between the two empirical WSV lines in Figure 7 justifies my prior argument that they should be disregarded for this analysis. On the other hand, it is clear that the raw and regressed curves in Figure 6 behave in the same manner. However, despite their similar behavior, the vertical difference between the lines in Figure 6 can lead to somewhat different conclusions. If the raw values are accepted, then one might deduce that nearly half of the first-round picks (specifically, picks 8 through 21) symbolize market inefficiencies. On the other hand, if the regressed values are taken as a baseline, then one would find that only two first-round picks represent true bargains (specifically, the ninth and tenth picks). Thus, it is clear how one can deduce different results dependent on which data set is taken as truth. Nevertheless, taking both curves in Figure 6 into account, we can infer that mid-first-round picks are cost-effective relative to early- and late-first-round slots. 5.3 To Be Continued I believe that this is about as far as I can come in analyzing the value of first-round picks in the NBA draft. With the conclusion that I drew in the preceding section, I have found an answer to the (re-stated) second big question that I asked about NBA draft pick value (“At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”) in a previous chapter. As for my third question about pick trade value, I could use my existing IP sets to tackle this topic, but I don’t think I would provide meaningful insight because, in my opinion, the trade values should encompass both first and second round pick. Thus, I must attempt to model second-round picks and re-calculate IPs in order to give a worthwhile answer to this question. However, I will leave this task for another time. As a note to the reader, the next couple of paragraphs discuss nuanced details about the IPs that I can calculate with my existing data sets. So, if you couldn’t care less about these kinds of details, go ahead and skip to the next section.↩ As a technical note, I have chosen to shown the IP values for WSVs instead of those for win shares (WS), cost, or profit because they will be used in the upcoming analysis on market inefficiencies.↩ I have chosen to use these data sets for the same reasons outlined in detail in the following argument regarding which WSV IPs to use.↩ In case you were wondering, I have simply chosen the raw theoretical four-year cost IPs instead of its regressed counterparts because the raw values mirror the actual rookie wage scale.↩ "],
["indifferent-probability-and-nba-draft-pick-value-cont-.html", "6 Indifferent Probability and NBA Draft Pick Value, Cont. 6.1 A Second Look at the Second Round 6.2 Final Thoughts", " 6 Indifferent Probability and NBA Draft Pick Value, Cont. In this chapter I will continue where I left off in my prior discussion of the concept of indifferent probability (IP) and its application to the NBA draft. You may recall that we have only evaluated first-round draft slots up to this point because the contracts of second-round picks is non-deterministic, as I discussed in my chapter on the big-picture value of NBA draft picks. Nevertheless, I was able to answer my (re-stated) “second” big question about NBA draft pick value (“At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”), which I brought up in another chapter. I found that, when considering only first round picks, the picks in the middle of the round are most cost-effective. Now, if I attempt to model second-round picks and re-calculate IPs, I can provide a more realistic answer to the “third” question (“What is the relative trade value of picks?”) that I asked in a previous chapter. Furthermore, with these updated IP values I can re-evaluate my conclusion about the cost-effectiveness of mid-first-round picks. I attempt to do both of these tasks in this chapter. 6.1 A Second Look at the Second Round Perhaps you believe that my prior conclusion about the value to be had with mid-first round picks was not extremely convincing. As a point of reference, I have reproduced the graphs that I led me to this conclusion in Figures 1 and 2. To make my prior analysis more absolute, I need to try to incorporate the value, cost, and profit of second-round picks so that the desirability of first-round picks is_ enhanced and more closely matches reality. I have simply looked at top 30 picks in isolation so far. However, if I can model second-round picks like I have modeled first-round picks up to this point, I can (hopefully) get a more accurate perspective of the first half of the draft. Figure 1: Average Theoretical Four-Year First-Round WSV and Cost IPs Figure 2: Average Theoretical Four-Year First-Round WSV to Cost IPDifferentials The truth is that, even if second-round picks can generate an enormous amount of profit by producing a higher-than-expected number of win shares (WS) while playing on non-guaranteed and lower-paying salaries, very few of picks after the top 30 ever become much more than an acceptable role player at best. With this fact in mind, we can better contextualize the fact that top 30 picks, even if they do cost more than second-round picks and can sometimes become busts, have historically generated more profit than second-round picks. Therefore, using the worst of the first-round picks as a baseline for calculations (as we have done so far) somewhat depreciates the value and profitability of the other picks because the baseline is higher than it should be.55 How do we model second-round picks? To begin, I can start with WS and then translate them to a monetary value just as we did before. Getting empirical WS for bottom 30 picks is simple, and finding their theoretical counterparts is simply a matter of identifying the smallest 30 WS values when re-sorting each round in my 1995-2012 sample size by WS instead of pick. Converting WS to win shares value (WSV) is also the same as before.56 Without looking up the contracts of all rookies in the drafts since 1995 (as I avoided doing before), I can’t actually get the true empirical four-year cost of drafted players. That’s not a such big deal for first-round picks because their contracts follow a fairly predictable pattern. I can say disregard the importance of exceptions to this pattern by arguing that all of my analysis is meant to reflect the expectations of a team going into the draft. In other words, odd cases, such as when first-round busts are released before the third or fourth year of their contracts, should not be modeled explicitly, even if they are possible.57 For second-round picks, I will make the assumption that they earn league-minimum salaries guaranteed over the course of four years. In reality, the most common case is that bottom 30 picks sign one- or two-year deals for minimum or near minimum salary. However, this occurrence is not the most common by a definitively wide margin, and many other possibilities have been observed historically. For example, opportunities can vary from a contract with no guarantees after the first year.58 Finally, with that huge assumption about player salaries out of the way, calculating profit is just as easy as it before.59 As a technical note, in order to distinguish these new total draft data sets, I use the descriptor “Rd-1&amp;2” in my labels, or I simply don’t add “Rd-1”, as I have done before when identifying regressed values calculated with first-round data in isolation. Sometimes I do not use either of these descriptors with raw values (which encompasses all picks in the first and second draft rounds). When I use only the first-round raw data, then I simply take the top 30 data points; when I use both first- and second-round data, then I use all 60 data points in the draft set. 6.1.1 (Revised) Market Inefficiency I’ve done a lot of talking without any new numbers or graphs to show. So, for the purpose of keeping you engaged, I will ease up on the words here. Figures 3 and 4 that follow are analogues to Figures 1 and 2 using the IPs calculated for the complete first- and second-round data. Figure 3: Average Theoretical Four-Year First- and Second-Round WSV andCost IPs Figure 4: Average Theoretical Four-Year First- and Second-Round WSV toCost IP Differentials Figures 3 and 4 reaffirm what we inferred from Figures 1 and 2. That is, mid-round picks are true bargains (i.e. they are cost-effective relative to the rest of the picks). Furthermore, these graphs assert what most experts intuitively agree is true—late-round picks are also profitable. This observation isn’t necessarily implied by Figures 1 and 2. In fact, one could say that those graphs imply the opposite. However, this new deduction alludes to my rationale for re-doing the prior analysis focusing only on first-round data—as an NBA fan who has observed the game for a long time, my intuition told me that a conclusion that could not show that late first-round picks were bargain was not completely accurate. Thus, I felt obliged to try to account for the value and cost of second-round picks. If you still aren’t convinced that mid-round picks represent bargains, you should look at the analysis done at 82games.com by Aaron Barzilai, which I summarized in a previous chapter. Figure 8 in his research, which I reproduce below, captures the same idea that I present here in my Figure 3 (but no so much my Figure 1, which only graphs first-round data). Interestingly, Barzilai found that the last pick in the first round is worth about 20% of the first pick, while I calculated that it was around 16%. It is very reassuring to see that my number closely matches his, despite the relatively large assumptions I have made about the cost of second-round picks. Even more interestingly, Barzilai found that the 9th pick represents the greatest market inefficiency, as I have defined it in my discussion. Likewise, I found that the 9th picks had the largest IP differentials averaged across all four IP differential data sets shown in my Figures 2 and 4. Perhaps this is just a coincidence. Nevertheless, it is nice to verify that my analysis seems to be valid. Let me say one more thing about late first-round picks, even though I’m not exactly sure how to prove it definitively or in some easy-to-understand manner. I would argue that the profitability of__ late first-round picks__ derives more from their low cost relative to the theoretical talent-level available at those slots, while the profitability of mid-first round picks arises more from greater talent relative to the cost. Before moving on, I should note that recalculating everything up to this point means that I now have 24 data sets (and 24 corresponding sets of IPs): 8 for raw empirical and theoretical WS, WSVs, cost, and profit (which encompass all 60 data points for a given draft, but may be cut off at the midpoint in analysis that only looks at first-round picks); 8 for their counterparts regressed using only the top 30 data points; and 8 more regressed over all 60 data points. Just as before, the new first- and second-round regressed data sets have IPs that are consistent with themselves, so there are really only 12 unique sets of IPs. 6.1.2 NBA Draft Pick Trade Value Even if you still aren’t convinced about the prior conclusions regarding which first-round picks are the most cost-effective relative to one another. the good news is that IPs can be used for other analysis. For example, I can determine the relative trade value of the right to owning a pick (before a player is selected at the slot) by using my sets of IPs. In other words, I can determine how much teams should be willing to trade one pick for another (or more). For the sake of this analysis, I will only consider first-round picks in a given (arbitrary) year without any pick-related restrictions nor any knowledge of available players. Specifically, I am not going to try to account for the inflated value of picks in future drafts, the possibility of protected picks, nor experts’ evaluation of the incoming prospects. As with calculating IPs, the calculations here are straightforward. All that needs to be done is to divide the IP of the pick(s) to be sent by that of the pick(s) to be received. I could use any one of our sets of IPs, but I will use the ones for raw and regressed theoretical first- and second-round WS. The rationale for this choice is the same as that for evaluating market inefficiencies, with the exception of using WS and instead of WSV. I have decided to use WS here because I feel that they correlate most closely with our notion of trade value. By this I mean to say that player talent and on-court production is typically the primary concern in (non-draft-related) trades, and the matching of salary obligations is the secondary concern. Furthermore, WS seems like the right choice to me because teams probably associate picks more strongly with the player and basketball production to be had, as opposed to the monetary value to be gained, in which case I might choose to use the IPs for WSV or profit.60 Figure 5 shows the raw and regressed theoretical WS IPs (in percentages) with respect to the first pick. The numbers calculated for each data set incorporates data for both rounds. (This distinction is important to note for the regressed data because we have regressed versions using only first-round data and a newer version that attempts to model the second round as well.) Figure 5: First-Round Draft Pick Trade Value Notably, the inclusion of second-round data prevents the data sets from decreasing to zero over the span of the top 30 picks. I would say that this first- and second-round model gives percentages that are more representative of the truth (in comparison to using only first-round data) because we cannot simply dismiss the value of second round picks altogether if we wish to make an effort to evaluate realistic possibilities regarding pick swaps. Even though the straight-up exchange of picks is not all too common (because draft trades typically also include non-rookie players), those that do occur often include second round picks. That is, a swap of first-round picks, even if it involves multiple picks from one side or future first-round picks, almost never happens. In review of the numbers in Figure 5, I am inclined to believe that those in the second set—those using the regressed theoretical WS IPs—are more realistic. In particular, the 17% relative value of the 30th pick with respect to the top pick seems like a better estimate than the 10% estimate given by the raw data set, which just seems too deflated. Moreover, if I were to have included the percent values for picks 31 to 60 in Figure 5, you would observe that the numbers continue to decrease monotonically. In light of this fact, we can deduce neither of these data sets seems to capture the belief of NBA analytical experts that high second-round pick represent bargains. They say that these picks, like mid-first round picks, generate greater profit relative to their cost because there is a non-trivial chance of selecting a relatively talented player at the top of the second round on a team-friendly contract that does not need to abide by the rookie wage scale. Actually, I would have been surprised if I had seen the percentages take a small jump around picks 30 and 31 in the WS IPs scaled with respect to the first pick. I would only expect to see this phenomenon in the scaled WSV or__ profit IPs because these data sets account for monetary returns and cost__. In fact, this effect DOES _manifest in both the scaled raw empirical and theoretical first- and second-round profit IPs. Figure 6 shows the latter of these two data sets. (I do not show the former because it is relatively noisy). Figure 6: First- and Second-Round Draft Pick Trade Value Figure 6 makes it is evident that the two or three picks at the top of the second round are more desirable (in terms of cost efficiency) than the last couple of picks in the first round.61 Finally, I can look at the value of all picks relative to one another. Figure 7 shows the trade value of the top ten picks relative to one another in a matrix format.62 Figure 7: Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value I must say that my Figure 7 is inspired by a chart shown in an article by Wages of Wins writer Arturo Galletti meant to portray the same idea. I reproduce a cropped version of his figure below. Figure 8: Arturo Galletti’s Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value If you compare our numbers for the top 10 picks, you can see that we come up with similar estimates. In actuality, we would come up with exactly the same numbers if we had used precisely the same method. As I noted in a previous chapter, Galletti simply calculates the quotient of the values for any given two picks to come up with their relative trade value. However, in my method, I first scale all the monetary values to a 0-to-1 unit-less basis before taking the quotient of any given two numbers. As I note there, I believe that my method for calculating relative values using IPs is superior because it does not result in negative values. Negative values do not have any meaning on a relative scale of magnitude. The fact that Galletti and I are on the same page is not too surprising considering that we have very similar methodologies. However, our results are fairly different from the unit-less values that can be derived from the peak VORP numbers of Nylon Calculus’S Nick Restifo. (In case you missed it, I mentioned both Galletti’s and Restifo’s results on this topic in a previous chapter. After translating Restifo’s peak VORP numbers to IPs, I can put his trade value numbers on equal ground with mine and those of Galletti. Figure 8 presents the results. Figure 9: Nick Restifo’s Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value Clearly, his numbers deviate fairly significantly from mine and Galletti’s. This trend becomes even more extreme as the pick number increase beyond 10. However, as I discussed in that previous chapter, it is not really fair to compare the chart that can be derived from Galletti’s regressed “Net Actual Value” numbers (which are equivalent to my profit numbers translated to IPs and generate the exact same chart as the one I present in my Figure 7) and the chart that I derive from Restifo’s estimates. Mine and Galletti’s discount basketball production with cost, while Restifo’s measure basketball production only. Nevertheless, even after I account for the cost factor to put Galletti’s and Restifo’s numbers on the same basis, the relative trade value numbers still differ noticeably. Figure 9 shows Galletti’s basketball-production-only numbers that reflect the same idea as Restifo’s normalized values in Figure 8. Figure 10: Arturo Galletti’s Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value (Neglecting Cost) The answer to the question of whose numbers are more accurate depend on your preference for basketball-production evaluation. Galletti and I use average empirical four-year wins produced (WP) and win shares (WS) respectively for our on-court value measurements, while Restifo employs best two-year VORP. 6.2 Final Thoughts So, how much should teams be willing to trade for draft picks (in terms of other draft picks)? Unfortunately, my best answer is “it depends”. Anyways, there are so many other factors that can inflate or deflate trade values—such as a team’s current cap situation, the number of picks that it holds in the given year’s draft or in future drafts, etc.–that this question would be difficult to answer definitively without being very specific in its statement. For example, it would probably be better to ask something like “Given that the Boston Celtics have three first-round picks and three second-round picks in this draft, six more second-round picks in the next two drafts, and enough cap room to fit two maximum salary players on their roster, should they offer the Sacramento Kings a deal including their top three picks from this draft, as well as all of their second-round picks in the next two years, in return for DeMarcus Cousins?” Of course, even if I were to try to answer a question like this, whatever conclusion I come up with would be difficult to generalize. Nevertheless, because this depreciation affects all top 30 picks relatively equally, it does not mean that any of our analysis should be disregarded. It is still valid because it is consistent with itself, even if it may not reflect reality with complete 100% accuracy.↩ If you recall, I simply multiplied the number of WS by the appropriate average four-year WSV. So far, so good. However, estimating cost is where things start to get ambiguous.↩ Anyways, these cases are captured by taking averages and regressions.↩ Danny Greenhas turned out to be a respectable role player after being waivedafter his rookie year with the Cleveland Cavaliers. to a more optimistic agreement to a longer-term deal (which often comes with some down-side such as team options to release the player after a certain number of years).↩ It’s just the difference of the WSV and cost. We can regress each set of these new “first- and second-round” data sets for WS, WSV, cost, and profit just as we did before for the “first-round” ones. As you will see, we can apply the broader two-round model on a case-by-case analysis for the rest of our analysis depending on where we judge its application is most appropriate, such as in identifying market inefficiencies and draft pick trade value.↩ In reality, the choice of WS over WSV is still somewhat arbitrary. Also, one can argue the importance of this choice is not all too significant because the majority of the sets of IP are very similar in their values, and the point of this analysis is just to introduce one of the many topics that can be investigated at a more granular level, given better research and insight.↩ As I indicated in a prior chapter , the 30th value is somewhat skewed by the fact that drafts prior to 2007 had only 29 teams. Also, the handful of values at the end of the second round are skewed for a less obvious reason. Often, the worst rookies in any given draft class can earn a negative amount of WS, so the sorting of players by descending WS, as is done with the theoretical data sets, can lead to some strange results. Moreover, because many years have had players drafted who never ended up playing in the NBA, there are simply not very many data points for the last couple of draft slots.↩ As a technical note, I use the regressed theoretical first- and second-round WS IPs about which I said I believed is the most accurate data set that I have to portray this concept.↩ "]
