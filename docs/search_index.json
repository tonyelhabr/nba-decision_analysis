(The website was known as “numbersense”.) I have not expended any time in updating any of the theory that I discussed. I have only edited the content to fix urls, spelling and grammar errors, etc. (Even despite these efforts, one might still find some “logistical” errors because I am the sole editor and, as a human, am prone to missing my own mistakes.) This book by no means represents the breadth of analysis of which I am capable. (In fact, the lack of statistical analysis demonstrated within may actually do a disservice to my reputability as a data scientist/analyst.) Nonetheless, I think this book is still worth publishing because the content is well researched and well thought-out. Also, on a personal note, I think this will be interesting to review in the future when gauging how I have developed as an analyst over my career. "],

In this introductory write-up I summarize conclusions made by other researchers about the biggest questions that I (and probably many others) have about the NBA draft pick value. I plan to follow this peer review up with a step-by-step guide where I will go into detail explaining my methodology and discoveries in attempting to answer to these questions for myself.1 1.1 The Question(s) 1.1.1 The Basic Question To be clear, the primary (or “first”) question that I am looking to answer can be stated explicitly as follows: “How valuable are NBA draft picks?” Before attempting to answer this question, I think that we should acknowledge that the term “value” is relatively ambiguous. In fact, I would say that the interpretation of “value” can lead to a range of different answers. Thus, I should be clear in how I intend to interpret it. From my point of view, the answer to the question depends on whether wants to define a player’s value either in terms of basketball production or monetary cost.;2 Thus, on one extreme, one can reasonably come up with one answer that completely neglects cost in favor of pure basketball production. (This kind of answer would emphasize draft slots at which selected players have historically produced the most basketball-wise, such as those at the top of the first round)). On the other extreme, an answer that completely neglects basketball production in favor of raw cost considerations might also be deduced.3 I am interested in trying to determine the answer to the question of “value” in two ways. One answer that considers only basketball production (i.e. the first kind of answer that I have suggested). Another answer that discounts basketball production with monetary cost. 1.1.2 A Related (and Better) Question I am also looking to answer the (“second”) question: “Are higher picks more valuable than lower picks?” Although this may seem like a simple restatement of the first question, I argue that its answer is different. I think the answer to this second question MUST consider both basketball production and monetary cost simultaneously. Furthermore, it must also weigh the significance of each of these factors on a relative basis with respect to the rest of the draft slots. Perhaps this second question is better phrased as “At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”4 In comparison, I would say that the first question is posed on an absolute scale, and its answer does not necessarily provide ground-breaking insight. Put another way, in answering the first question, it is reasonable to expect (and, as we will see, can be shown) that both basketball production and cost are highest for the top picks and lower for later picks. 1.2 The Answer(s) In this section I summarize and draw similarities among the methodologies and findings made by six researchers. I have listed the researchers and their writings in order of publication date.5 1. Justin Kubatko In a 2009 article published at his website Basketball Reference (which is like the mecca for all NBA stats nerds like me)), Justin Kubatko concisely documents his use of win shares (WS) to measure “expected value” (EV). In specific, he tracks the WS accumulated throughout the entire careers of players drafted from 1977 to 1991 (because all players who had been drafted in that year range had retired by the time of his analysis) and employs linear regression with a logarithmic transformation (i.e. linear-log regression) to come up with a formula for EV—EV = 76.9 - 18.8 * log(pick). Moreover, he records WS earned in only the first four years of a player’s career (to account for the conventional length of rookie contracts under the NBA’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA)) for all players drafted from 1977 to 2005 (meaning that all players drafted in the last year of that range had the opportunity to play four years) to come up with another linear-log formula for EV—EV = 26.5 - 6.3 * log(pick). In summary, Kubatko clearly infers that the “value” to be gained from draft slots diminishes with increasing pick number. However, his take is solely phrased in terms of basketball production; he stops short of putting his results in terms of monetary units. In relation to the questions that I have posed, Kubatko’s formulas and tables gives an answer that considers only basketball-production to my first question of general NBA draft pick value. 2. Aaron Barzilai In a somewhat formal research article posted at 82games.com, Aaron Barzilai builds upon the work of Kubatko using data from 1980 to 2007. He analyzes production in terms of four different metrics–PER-minutes, player wins, WS, and estimated salary—and he looks at each metric over three different time periods—__career, first four years, and years with rookie team.6 Like Kubatko, Barzilai presents an answer to my first question of big-picture draft pick value in terms of basketball production. Furthermore, as can be inferred from the above graph, he also provides an answer to my second question regarding the cost-effectiveness of picks. 3. Arturo Galletti In a 2013 post, Arturo Galletti, one of the main contributors at Wages of Wins, provides some interesting visuals in describing his take on the subject. Without specifying exactly which years he drew data from, he uses wins produced (WP) to measure basketball value, translates WP to a monetary value using an estimate of \\(1.7 million per win, and finds the net monetary value by taking the difference of the monetary WP and the CBA’s rookie salary obligation for each draft slot. Following the precedent set by Kubatko and Barzilai, Galletti accounts for the typical length of the contracts of first-round picks by averaging all data over the __first four seasons__ after draft year. However, because he also considers the monetary obligations of these contracts under the CBA, which only applies to first-round picks, he only evaluates the top 30 picks. (Kubtako and Barzilai models all 60 picks because they do not attempt to contextualize the monetary value of picks and wins.) After applying a linear-log regression, Galletti finds __&quot;Value of Wins [\\) Million]”:__ -13.79 * ln(pick) + 52.785 and “Net Actual Value [$ Million]”: -8.991 * ln(pick) + 32.705. Galletti’s regression graph is shown below. In contextualizing Galletti’s findings with respect to my questions, it is evident that he answers my first question in both fashions for which I sought an answer—his “Avg Wins Per Pick” and “Net Actual Value” data sets give answers for value in terms of pure basketball production and basketball production discounted by cost. 4. Nate Silver Next, Nate Silver took a look at the issue ahead of the 2014 draft at his website FiveThirtyEight. Using data from 1985 through 2014 and extrapolating data for rookies from the 2012 to 2014), Silver makes formulation that is similar to that of Galletti. Like Galletti, he finds the “Net Profit” (the analogue of Galletti’s “Net Actual Value”) of first-round draft picks after translating wins to currency and discounting these values (which he calls “Net Value Produced at Free-Agent Market Rate”) by rookie salary obligations. However, unlike Galletti, Silver uses WS as his choice for evaluating basketball production, and he evaluates everything on a five-year basis.7 With his “Net Value Produced at Free-Agent Market Rate” and “Net Profit” data sets, Silver analysis provides answers to my first question in terms of pure basketball production and cost-discounted basketball production. 5. Saurabh Rane More recently, just ahead of the 2016 draft Saurabh Rane tackled the question of NBA draft pick value in a guest post in Nylon Calculus. Employing first-round data for the rookie classes from 1985 to 2012, he evaluates players with respect to their highest single-season __[value over replacement player][(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player)__ (VORP) over the course of their careers. His approach is arguably more granular than that of others, which makes it relatively distinct. He neglects money considerations entirely and classifies players into one of four quartiles —All-NBA First-Teamer (top 2.5%), All-Star (top 10%), rotation player, or bust—while looking at seven ranges of picks—first, early lottery (picks 2 and 3), early-mid lottery (picks 4 to 6), mid-late lottery ( picks 7 to 10), late lottery (picks 11 to 14), mid-late first (picks 15 to 22), and late-first (picks 23 to 30). ^[In classifying rookies into four tiers, his approach somewhat mirrors that of a 2015 FiveThirtyEight piece authored by Neil Pane and Zach Bradshaw in which they forecast that year’s draft prospects using applied statistics. However, although he doesn’t provide explicit values in tabular form or implicit ones in the form of an equation, Rane’s charts, on of which can be seen above, clearly answer my first question about the general relationship between value and draft pick in terms of on-court production. He verifies the deductions made by others (either empirically or mathematically) that the pure basketball production that can be expected of higher picks is much greater than that for lower picks, and that this drop-off is non-linear (for potential All-First Teamers and All-Stars). Put another way, he asserts that the chance of a player becoming elite (i.e. All-First Teamer or All-Star) is not linearly related to their draft position; rather, top picks have a much greater chance at becoming All-Stars or All-NBA First-Teamers. 6. Michael Lopez Writing even more recently than Rane is Michael Lopez, an Assistant Professor of Statistics at Skidmore College. He provides some input on the NBA in a broader analysis that compares the importance of draft picks in the four major American team sports. For the NBA draft specifically, he uses career WS and a locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing (LOESS) regression to model data from 1990 to 2005. Like Rane, he cannot provide a formula for the regression, as a consequence of using LOESS. Nevertheless, he finds that the relative value of late second-round picks is much less (about 20 times less) than that of top picks, which confirms the empirical notion of experts and the findings of other researchers that superstars dominate the NBA.8 In summary, Lopez’s research goes as far as Kubatko’s and Rane’s in its relevance to answering my questions—that is, it provides an answer to the big-picture question of value gained from draft picks, but only in terms of basketball production.9 1.2.1 The Aggregate Answer(s) At the very least, each of the six analysts I have mentioned here—Kubatko, Barzilai, Galletti, Silver, Rane, and Lopez—modeled the relationship between draft position and basketball production, providing one of the two types of answers to my first question regarding the general value of draft picks. Although they differed in their choices for metric for assessing basketball production (e.g. WS, VORP, etc.), sample size of data (i.e range of draft years), the time span for evaluating production (e.g. four years, career, etc.), and their methods for regression (e.g. linear-log, LOESS, etc.), they all came to the basically the same conclusion—that is, that players who are selected earlier are likely to outperform those selected later (which is precisely what a rational observer would hypothesize).10 Furthermore, Galletti and Silver go beyond simply measuring the value of draft slots in terms of basketball production and contextualize it in terms of monetary cost, which is what I sought in a second type of answer to my first question about big-picture NBA draft pick value. Nevertheless, n all cases studied, each researcher found the relationship between value and draft slot to have a decaying, non-linear characteristic. Finally, I should note that Barzilai provides an answer to my second question about the cost-effectiveness of picks. He shows that mid-first-round picks give the greatest “return on investment” relative to the rest of the top 30 picks. 1.3 Final Thoughts In my own take (which you can read in an upcoming post), I plan to draw inspiration mostly from Galletti and Silver because I want to do my best to evaluate the picks from a monetary perspective. However, I am intent on using a different methodology and providing some (slightly) different analysis.11 I plan to discuss some closely related topics as well.↩ Notably, one can even interpret basketball production and monetary cost in a number of different ways, although the former is typically evaluated in terms of an “all-in-one” advanced metric and the latter is typically evaluated in terms of salary obligations.↩ Such an answer would favor those slots where picks have historically received the least amount of money from contracts, such as those in the late in the second.↩ Admittedly, this re-phrasing isn’t something someone would say in normal conversation.↩ Consequently, answers to the questions that I have posed are not given in an outlined fashion.↩ Barzilai doesn’t analyze the third time period much in his discussion. After discarding the combination of estimated salary for the non-career time stints, he comes up with 10 data sets. He normalizes on a percentage basis relative to the top pick such that the units of the dependent-variable (i.e. the basketball-production metric) are eliminated. After taking an average of the seven data sets not involving time spent with rookie team, he comes up with an explicit formula for “relative value” (which I will abbreviate as RV)–RV: 0.947 exp(-0.05331 ^ (pick - 1)). Although Barzilai doesn’t directly contextualize his results in terms of money, he finds that the later picks are relatively undervalued when comparing a normalized curve for estimated value with a normalized curve for rookie salary obligations (dictated by the CBA).↩ Both of these are relatively minute differences.↩ Furthermore, aside from verifying the dramatic drop-off in on-court production with increasingly lower draft position, Lopez finds that the drop-off is more dramatic in the NBA than in the other three major American team sports. In other words, he shows that the top NBA picks are more valuable that the early picks in the drafts of other sports.↩ I do not mean to discredit Lopez (or Kubatko or Rane) for not supplying answers to all of my questions. I acknowledge that each author had unique intentions in their research. For example, Lopez was concerned with expected value in sports other than just the NBA.↩ The thinking behind the hypothesis that the production of players in the NBA (or any sport) correlates relatively closely with draft position is that players selected at higher slots demonstrate higher ability and potential to improve before being drafted, so they are more likely to succeed and add value to their teams. Lopez finds that this is true for each of the four major American sports For the NBA specifically, this correlation between on-court value and draft position has been verified in research looking at various lengths of time: Rane and Lopez evaluated value added over the length of players’ entire careers, Galletti and Silver solely considered the time spanning the length of players’ rookie contracts, and Kubatko and Barzilai looked at both of these periods of time.↩ For example, while Silver makes a rigorous effort to account for exceptions to the rule-of-thumb for rookie contracts, I think I will be happy to ignore these cases. To name one way in which I will differ from Galletti, I plan on using WS, not WP, for evaluating basketball production. Furthermore, while Silver uses his model to focus nearly exclusively on the value of the top pick, and Galletti hinges his analysis to evaluate the importance of draft picks for winning championships, I’m interested in a variety of issues. I will try to provide enough basis for further analysis by deriving several models, including one that I can leverage to either verify or deny Barzilai’s implication that picks in the teens are more cost-effective than those at the top and bottom of the first round.↩ "],
["what-research-says-about-nba-draft-pick-value-part-2.html", "2 What Research Says about NBA Draft Pick Value, Part 2 2.1 More Questions 2.2 More Answers", " 2 What Research Says about NBA Draft Pick Value, Part 2 Having asked and answered the biggest question(s) about the value of NBA draft picks in [my last post][1], there are a couple more questions that I sought to have answered (and will attempt to answer myself in my upcoming step-by-step guide to estimating NBA draft pick value.) If you haven’t read that post, you should definitely check it out because I will reference some of the research discussed there in this post. 2.1 More Questions 2.1.1 The Third Question Picking up where I left off, I can articulate two other questions (i.e. “third” and “fourth” questions) that I sought to answer in my earlier review of existing research.12 In considering the meaning of “value” as I did before, I think answers for this question contextualized in terms of either basketball production or monetary cost are equally valid. Some general managers might be fascinated with the superstar potential of a particular prospect and, consequently, would be willing to give up other assets (e.g. experienced players, future picks, etc.) to move up in the draft and pick that talented player. On the other hand, some may be more concerned with cap considerations or trying to “beat the market” by moving into slots that are most “cost-effective”.13 2.1.2 The Fourth (and Final) Question Finally, the last question that I looked to answer (for now) is “Can tanking be justified?”14 Even though this fourth question does not explicitly include the word “value”, I believe that its answer is still dependent upon the word’s interpretation. In this context, it is probably easiest to interpret its answer on the basis of on-court basketball production, as opposed to off-court monetary cost. In particular, I think a reasonable analysis of the question might compare the chances of a team winning the championship against the likelihood of improving the team with a higher draft pick. In this case, it might be necessary to evaluate “value” on a relative scale because winning a championship is a binary variable (i.e win or no win), whereas the unit of measurement is different for cost (i.e. $ million for rookie contracts) ands for the researcher’s statistic(s) of choice for quantifying basketball production (e.g. an “all-in-one” metric like win shares (WS)). As you can see from this caveat-filled discussion (as well as the one in my last post) the term “value” is fairly ambiguous. Nevertheless, having defined it in a specific way for each question, I think we can now better contextualize the answers provided by existing research. 2.2 More Answers 2.2.1 The Third Answer My third question is answered directly in one of the articles I have already reviewed. Arturo Galletti translates his regressed “Net Actual Value” values (which he calls “Modeled Values”) to relative ones for the purpose of constructing a pick trade value chart. This chart is shown below. After inspecting Galletti’s regression formula and his numbers for “Modeled Value”, I found that he simply calculates the quotient of the values for any given two picks to come up with their relative trade value. However, I think it is better to use an alternative method that leverages the concept of indifference probability (IP) to calculate relative trade values (as I do in [a separate post][5]) where I first scale all the monetary values to a 0-to-1 unit-less basis before taking the quotient of any two values. I believe that my method for calculating relative values using IPs is superior because it does not result in negative values for second-round picks. In particular, if Galletti were to have expanded his chart to include all 60 picks, you would begin to see negative values for picks 38 and below when their values are calculated with respect to the top pick. Anyways, the following figure depicts how Galletti’s numbers would look for the top 10 picks using my proposed alternative method using IPs. Aside from Galletti, Nylon Calculus contributor Nick Restifo provides a trade value chart posted in a recent 2016 article at Fansided. Similar to Saurabh Rane, Restifo uses peak value over replacement player (VORP) values (although he averages over the combined best two-year VORP value rather than simply taking the best single-season value), and, like Michael Lopez, he runs a LOESS regression (although he keeps the raw value of the top pick). Although Restifo’s chart is not normalized like Galletti’s, the value of certain picks relative to one another can be interpreted by finding the absolute difference between the listed values of the picks of interest.15 Interestingly, after Restifo’s absolute VORP numbers are normalized to a unit-less 0-to-1 basis using the same alternative method that I used to re-calculate Galletti’s numbers, it turns out that his relative trade value numbers differ relatively dramatically from Galletti’s. The following figure mirrors the same idea shown in the previous figure for Galletti using the calculated relative values for Restifo. So whose numbers should be taken as truth? As it often seems to be in analytical discussion like this, the answer is “it depends” . We must realize that the two sets of normalized numbers are calculated in a different context—Restifo looks only at_ basketball production, while Galletti discounts on-court value by rookie wage scale cost. I can make an effort to account for this difference by using Galletti’s regressed “$ Value of Wins” formula estimating the monetary value of wins. Recognizing that this formula—although it is described in units of currency—correlates directly with Galletti’s basketball production “Avg Wins per Pick” data set, I can review how Galletti and Restifo stack up on an equal basis after normalizing these basketball production values with the regression formula that Galletti provides for his “\\(alue of Wins [\\) million]”. In doing so, I come up with numbers that describe the same idea—basketball production. Having back-tracked Galletti’s numbers to neglect cost, the only difference in the two basketball production estimates is that Galletti’s numbers are based on wins produced (WP), which is fairly similar to win shares (WS), while Restifo’s are based on peak VORP. The following figure shows Galletti’s trade value estimates for the top 10 picks calculated for his basketball production metric. So, even after accounting for Galletti’s slightly different method of calculating relative values, negating the cost factor incorporated into Galletti’s original numbers, and normalizing the Restifo’s VORP numbers, it still appears that Galletti’s and Restifo’s trade value estimates vary fairly noticeably. (In fact, it appears that their estimates differ even more now!) As I implied before, this difference arises purely from each writer’s choice of basketball-production metric. Thus, despite my efforts to account for differences in methodology between two researchers, I will leave this discussion at this point. All that is to be said is that the answer to my third question regarding relative trade value depends on your evaluation of the merit of a given advanced metric. 2.2.2 The Fourth (and Final) Answer Finally, as with my third question, an answer to my fourth question can be found in one of the articles I have already summarized. Rane leverages his estimates for draft pick value contextualized by likelihood of player outcome—All-NBA First-Teamer, All-Star, rotation player, or bust—and normalizes them on a percentage basis to estimate the expected value for a team BEFORE the final lottery spots are determined. The dashed and solid lines in his figure below depict the expected values before and after the teams drafting at each draft slot are finalized. Thus, by looking at Rane’s “prior” and “posterior” estimates, we can simulate the perspective of a team that is bound to miss the playoffs and might reasonably tank in order to improve its lottery odds. In comparing the two types of lines, Rane notes that tanking when one already has one of the bottom-three or bottom-four win-loss records is not beneficial, as is made evident by the flattening of the dashed curves for the All-NBA First-Teamer and All-Star for the very top draft slots.16 While Rane does not explicitly confirm that the converse is true—that tanking can be beneficial for losing teams that are below average but not egregiously bad—he implies that tanking is not justified for mid-lottery and low-lottery teams either. He notes that the relative indifference in odds of netting an elite player (i.e. All-NBA First-Teamer or All-Star) within the mid-lottery range of picks suggests that these picks aren’t actually as valuable as some pundits have suggested, with respect to producing superstar players. Rather, the linear rise of the rotation and bust lines in the mid-lottery range suggests that higher picks in this range only generate good baseline players (i.e. rotation players or busts) with increased likelihood.17 Rane’s conclusions are backed up by a Journal of Sports Economics study published earlier this year. (This study is concisely summarized by renown American writer Jonah Lehrer on his blog.)18 Published under the lead of Akira Motomura, the research paper concludes that a team’s general management and other intangible infrastructural influences (i.e. “team culture”) has a stronger influence on the success of a team than do the draft slot it earns and the players that they draft. In specific, Motomura et. al. find that picks 1 through 3 tend to have a relatively neutral impact on the near-future win-loss records of their respective teams, that picks 4 through 10 actually have a negative impact over the following years19 A number of factors can explain the conclusion that tanking lacks merit. For one, it is understandable that even the most talented rookies cannot make a huge impact and turn franchises around immediately because they tend to make many more mistakes than their veteran peers, who can make up for any age-induced talent diminishment with their experience and knowledge of the game’s ins-and-outs at the professional level. Veterans tend to garner more respect from referees than younger players, understand the tendencies of opponents after having played them numerous times, and know how to pace themselves in a manner such that they don’t wear down by end of the regular season. Even after young players move on from their rookie seasons, they often don’t mature and reach their full potential for another couple of years. Aside from the experience advantage that discounts the effect of young players, there is also the fact that picking players in the draft is an inexact science. Teams at the top of the draft often pick players that turn out to be busts. Although tanking can increase the probability of earning a high draft slot, the expected value of a pick is just that—an expectation. There is no guarantee that teams will select the best player for them. As Motomura et. al. argue, drafting players and player development are skills that derive from the foresight and teaching capabilities of the team’s management. Thus, a draft pick’s expected value is heavily influenced by the team that is selecting at that slot, which is not reflected in any publicly available draft pick value model of which I am aware.20 While the research of Rane and Motomura et. al. suggest that tanking is not justified, Arturo Gutierrez finds in his research article The NBA Lottery and Game Theory that there are cases that tanking can be the “correct strategy”. For his analysis, Gutierrez first formulates an estimate of draft pick value by running a polynomial regression over the career WS earned by players drafted by teams ordered by win-loss record.21 Then, he formulates an estimate for the likelihood of a team winning the championship by running a separate regression over the historical results of teams ranked by playoff seed, Next, he compares these regressed curves on a graph over a dependent axis with numbers counting from 1 to 30 in order to represent teams ordered by best win-loss record for any arbitrary season. Finally, after accounting for what he calls the “time value” of winning a championship (such that the values of his regressed curve for championship likelihood are boosted because chances of winning in the near future are added to the single-year values), Gutierrez outputs a graph that indicates that any team worse than the sixth-best team should purposely try to lose.22 I think that Gutierrez’s perspective on this matter suffers somewhat from its failure to consider mixed strategies and their equilibria. He considers only the pure strategies of expending all effort to be the best team or to be the worst team.23 Nevertheless, Gutierrez admits that there are limitations to his approach. He notes that the “best response” for a given team is dependent on its specific situation, including variable such as the team’s win-loss record and its perception of whether or not other teams are tanking. Thus, even though Gutierrez’s analysis offers some validity to tanking, I don’t think his evidence is sufficiently strong to override the case made by the research of Rane and Motomura et. al. 2.2.3 Final Thoughts In my [last post][1] I vowed to take a look at the value of draft picks in terms of basketball production and contractual costs after reviewing the methodologies and conclusions of other researchers. There, I found that the answers were fairly the same across all researchers. Moreover, I reviewed only one person (Aaron Barzilai) who really evaluated the cost-effectiveness of picks, a topic which I also plan to explore. Now, having reviewed what research has to say about the related topics of pick trade value and tanking and having coming to some non-universal answers, I plan to expand my investigation to include these subjects as well. Actually, to be truthful, I only postulated these questions while looking for answers to my previous two questions. The third question can be simply stated as “What is the relative trade value of picks?”↩ I mentioned the term “cost-effective” in my previous post without formally defining it. In reality, economics terms such as “cost-effective”, “beating the market”, and “return on investment” should be formally defined in an NBA context by the person conducting the cost analysis. In any matter, I think that the reader can probably correctly infer the author’s intended meaning if the author neglects to define such terms. Thus, I am interested in trying to come up with the answers to the third question from both kinds of “value” perspectives—purely basketball production and purely monetary cost. In particular, I would say that the monetary interpretation is interesting for identifying general managers who have tried to “outsmart” their colleagues.↩ The term “tanking” refers to a team that intentionally loses to try to improve its odds of winning the NBA lottery. The 14 teams that miss the playoffs are entered into a lottery that determines draft order. The teams with the worst records have the best chances of winning a higher draft slot. More detail about the lottery can be found at the satirical NBA Tankathon website.↩ As an aside, one should realize that, even if the values of two lower picks is equal to that of a single higher one, one might reasonably prefer the higher upside presented by the higher draft pick, while someone else might prefer the “diversification” of having two prospects as opposed to one.↩ On the other hand, the final expected value of lottery picks between 5 and 14 generally is equal to (or greater than) before the finalized allocation of draft picks to teams.↩ On a related note, these trends reaffirm the raw conclusion that we made about the generalized draft pick value question—that basketball production drops off as pick number increases—and give a partial answer to my restated second question from before (“At which draft slots does the expected basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”) Using Rane’s illustrations, we can deduce that, in terms of pure basketball production, the value of mid-lottery and low-lottery picks are highly unlikely to generate elite players. Of course, the conclusions of others who have evaluated draft slots in terms of pure basketball production also implies the same principle, but Rane’s illustrations and rhetoric make this notion definitive.↩ I am thankful to Lehrer for his review of the study because I do not actually have access to the study.↩ Motomura et. al. find that these picks correlate to 6 to 9 more losses three years after the draft year, and that, more generally, all picks in the lottery range (and extending to pick 17) are associated with negative (or negligible at best) team performance. These numbers clearly suggest that tanking is not exactly the best strategy for teams looking to improve.↩ Accounting for how team factors correlate with the value extracted from draft picks would be a very difficult task that would require lots of probabilistic assumptions.↩ In contrast to the methods used by the researchers I discussed in my last post, he does not directly relate his choice of basketball production metric (in this case, WS) with draft slot; instead, he factors in the probabilistic relationship of lottery odds with team win loss-record to relate basketball production to teams ranked by record. Also, he uses a polynomial regression rather than a linear-log regression or a LOESS.↩ Without accounting for “time value”, then the intersection point manifests at the third-best team. This graph is shown in the figure below.↩ This perspective is like a manifestation of the idea that I described at the beginning of this post—evaluate tanking by comparing draft pick value and championship likelihood from a stict binary point of view.↩ "]
