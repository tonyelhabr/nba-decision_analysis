# Indifferent Probability and NBA Draft Pick Value, Cont.

In this chapter I will continue where I left off in [my prior discussion](1) of the
concept of
[__indifferent probability__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifferent) (IP) 
and its application to the NBA
draft. You may recall that we have only evaluated first-round draft slots up to
this point because the contracts of second-round picks is non-deterministic, as
I discussed in my chapter on the big-picture value of NBA draft
picks. Nevertheless, I was able to answer my (re-stated) "second" big question
about NBA draft pick value (“At which draft slots does the expected 
basketball production outperform the contractual obligation the most?”),
which I brought up in another chapter. I found that, when
considering only first round picks, the picks in the middle of the round are
most __cost-effective__.

Now, if I attempt to model second-round picks and re-calculate IPs, I can
provide a more realistic answer to the "third" question (__"What is the
relative trade value of picks?"__) that I asked in a previous chapter. Furthermore, with
these updated IP values I can re-evaluate my conclusion about the
cost-effectiveness of mid-first-round picks. I attempt to do both of these tasks
in this chapter.

## A Second Look at the Second Round

Perhaps you believe that my prior conclusion about the value to be had with
mid-first round picks was not extremely convincing. As a point of reference, I
have reproduced the graphs that I led me to this conclusion in Figures 1 and 2.

To make my prior analysis more absolute, I need to try to incorporate the value,
cost, and profit of second-round picks so that the desirability of first-round
picks is_ __enhanced__ and more closely __matches reality__. I have simply
looked at top 30 picks __in isolation__ so far. However, if I can model
second-round picks like I have modeled first-round picks up to this point, I can
(hopefully) get a more accurate perspective of the first half of the draft.

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability/figure-6-average-theoretical-four-year-first-round-wsv-to-cost-ip-differentials.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 2: Average Theoretical Four-Year __First-Round__ WSV to Cost IPDifferentials</p>

The truth is that, even if second-round picks can generate an enormous
amount of profit by producing a higher-than-expected number of win shares (WS)
while playing on non-guaranteed and lower-paying salaries, very few of picks
after the top 30 ever become much more than an acceptable role player at best.
With this fact in mind, we can better contextualize the fact that top 30 picks,
even if they do cost more than second-round picks and can sometimes become
busts, have historically generated more profit than second-round picks.
Therefore, using the worst of the first-round picks as a baseline for
calculations (as we have done so far) somewhat depreciates the value and
profitability of the other picks because the baseline is higher than it should
be. ^[Nevertheless, because this depreciation affects all top 30 picks relatively
equally, it does not mean that any of our analysis should be disregarded.
It is still valid because it is consistent with itself, even if it may not reflect reality with complete 100% accuracy.]

How do we model second-round picks? To begin, I can start with WS and then
translate them to a monetary value just as we did before. Getting empirical WS
for bottom 30 picks is simple, and finding their theoretical counterparts is
simply a matter of identifying the smallest 30 WS values when re-sorting each
round in my 1995-2012 sample size by WS instead of pick. Converting WS to win
shares value (WSV) is also the same as before.
^[If you recall, I simply multiplied the number of WS by the appropriate
average four-year WSV. So far, so good. However, estimating cost is where things
start to get ambiguous.]

Without looking up the contracts of all rookies in the drafts since 1995 (as
I avoided doing before), I can’t actually get the true empirical four-year cost
of drafted players. That’s not a such  big deal for first-round picks because
their contracts follow a fairly predictable pattern. I can say disregard the
importance of exceptions to this pattern by arguing that all of my analysis is
meant to reflect the expectations of a team __going into__ the draft. In other
words, odd cases, such as when first-round busts are released before the third
or fourth year of their contracts, __should not be modeled__ explicitly, even if
they are possible.
^[Anyways, these cases are captured by taking averages and regressions.]

For second-round picks, I will make the assumption that they earn
league-minimum salaries guaranteed over the course of four years. In reality,
the most common case is that bottom 30 picks sign one- or two-year deals for
minimum or near minimum salary. However, this occurrence is not the most common
by a definitively wide margin, and many other possibilities have been observed
historically. For example, opportunities can vary from a contract with no
guarantees after the first year.
^[Danny Green</a> has turned out to be a respectable role player
after <a href="http://stepienrules.com/2012-articles/former-cleveland-cavaliers-guard-danny-green.html">
being waived</a> after his rookie year with the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
to a more optimistic agreement to a longer-term deal (which often comes with
some down-side such as team options to release the player after a certain number of years).]

Finally, with that huge assumption about player salaries out of the way,
calculating profit is just as easy as it before.
^[It’s just the difference of the WSV and cost. We can regress each set of these new
"first- and second-round" data sets for WS, WSV, cost, and profit just as we did before for the "first-round" ones. 
As you will see, we can apply the broader two-round model on a case-by-case analysis for the rest of our analysis
depending on where we judge its application is most appropriate, such as in identifying market inefficiencies and draft pick trade value.]

As a technical note, in order to distinguish these new total draft data
sets, I use the descriptor “Rd-1&2” in my labels, or I simply don’t add “Rd-1”,
as I have done before when identifying regressed values calculated with
first-round data in isolation. Sometimes I do not use either of these
descriptors with raw values (which encompasses all picks in the first and second
draft rounds). When I use only the first-round raw data, then I simply take the
top 30 data points; when I use both first- and second-round data, then I use all
60 data points in the draft set.

### (Revised) Market Inefficiency

I've done a lot of talking without any new  numbers or graphs to show. So,
for the purpose of keeping you engaged, I will ease up on the words here.
Figures 3 and 4 that follow are analogues to Figures 1 and 2 using the IPs
calculated for the complete first- and second-round data.

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-3-average-theoretical-four-year-first-and-second-round-wsv-and-cost-ips.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 3: Average Theoretical Four-Year __First- and Second-Round__ WSV andCost IPs</p>

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-4-average-theoretical-four-year-first-and-second-round-wsv-to-cost-ip-differentials.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 4: Average Theoretical Four-Year __First- and Second-Round__ WSV toCost IP Differentials</p>

Figures 3 and 4 __reaffirm__ what we inferred from Figures 1 and 2. That is,
mid-round picks are true bargains (i.e. they are cost-effective relative to the
rest of the picks). Furthermore, these graphs assert what most experts
intuitively agree is true---late-round picks are also profitable. This
observation isn’t necessarily implied by Figures 1 and 2. In fact, one could say
that those graphs __imply the opposite__. __However__, this new deduction
alludes to my rationale for re-doing the prior analysis focusing only on
first-round data---as an NBA fan who has observed the game for a long time, my
intuition told me that a conclusion that could not show that late first-round
picks were bargain was not completely accurate. Thus, I felt obliged to try to
account for the value and cost of second-round picks.

If you still aren't convinced that mid-round picks represent bargains, you
should look at <a href="http://www.82games.com/barzilai1.htm">the analysis</a>
done at <a href="http://www.82games.com">82games.com</a> by <a
href="https://twitter.com/basketballvalue">Aaron Barzilai</a>, which I
summarized in a <a href="https://numbernonsense.updog.co/nba-draft-pick-value-research/">
previous chapter</a>. Figure 8 in his research, which I reproduce below, captures the same idea that I present here in my Figure 3
(but no so much my Figure 1, which only graphs first-round data). Interestingly, Barzilai
found that the last pick in the first round is worth about __20% of the first pick__, while I calculated that it was around __16%__.
It is very reassuring to see that my number closely matches his, despite the relatively large assumptions I have made about the cost of second-round picks.

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/aaron-barzilai-draft-pick-estimated-player-value-and-salary-graph.jpg)

Even more interestingly, Barzilai found that the __9th pick__ represents the
__greatest market inefficiency__, as I have defined it in my discussion.
Likewise, I found that the 9th picks had the largest IP differentials averaged
across all four IP differential data sets shown in my Figures 2 and 4. Perhaps
this is just a coincidence. Nevertheless, it is nice to verify that my analysis
seems to be valid.

Let me say one more thing about late first-round picks, even though I’m not
exactly sure how to prove it definitively or in some easy-to-understand manner.
I would argue that the profitability of__ late first-round picks__ derives more
from their __low cost__ relative to the theoretical talent-level available at
those slots, while the profitability of __mid-first round picks__ arises more
from __greater talent__ relative to the cost.

Before moving on, I should note that recalculating everything up to this
point means that I now have 24 data sets (and 24 corresponding sets of IPs): 8
for raw empirical and theoretical WS, WSVs, cost, and profit (which encompass
all 60 data points for a given draft, but may be cut off at the midpoint in
analysis that only looks at first-round picks); 8 for their counterparts
regressed using only the top 30 data points; and 8 more regressed over all 60
data points. Just as before, the new first- and second-round regressed data sets
have IPs that are consistent with themselves, so there are really only 12 unique
sets of IPs.

### NBA Draft Pick Trade Value

Even if you still aren’t convinced about the prior conclusions regarding
which first-round picks are the most cost-effective relative to one another. the
good news is that IPs can be used for other analysis. For example, I can
determine the relative trade value of the right to owning a pick (before a
player is selected at the slot) by using my sets of IPs. In other words, I can
determine how much teams should be willing to trade one pick for another (or
more).

For the sake of this analysis, I will only consider first-round picks in a
given (arbitrary) year without any pick-related restrictions nor any knowledge
of available players. Specifically, I am not going to try to account for the
inflated value of picks in future drafts, the possibility of protected picks,
nor experts’ evaluation of the incoming prospects.

As with calculating IPs, the calculations here are straightforward. All that
needs to be done is to divide the IP of the pick(s) to be sent by that of the
pick(s) to be received. I could use any one of our sets of IPs, but I will use
the ones for raw and regressed theoretical first- and second-round WS. The
rationale for this choice is the same as that for evaluating market
inefficiencies, __with the exception of using WS and instead of WSV__. I
have decided to use WS here because I feel that they correlate most closely
with
our notion of trade value. By this I mean to say that player talent and
on-court
production is typically the primary concern in (non-draft-related) trades, and
the matching of salary obligations is the secondary concern. Furthermore, WS
seems like the right choice to me because teams probably associate picks more
strongly with the player and basketball production to be had, as opposed to the
monetary value to be gained, in which case I might choose to use the IPs for
WSV
or profit.
^[In reality, the choice of WS over WSV is still somewhat arbitrary.
Also, one can argue the importance of this choice is not all too significant
because the majority of the sets of IP are very similar in their values,
and the point of this analysis is just to introduce one of the many topics
that can be investigated at a more granular level, given better research and
insight.]

Figure 5 shows the raw and regressed theoretical WS IPs (in percentages)
with respect to the first pick. The numbers calculated for each data set
incorporates data for both rounds. (This distinction is important to note for
the regressed data because we have regressed versions using only first-round
data and a newer version that attempts to model the second round as well.)

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-5-first-round-draft-pick-trade-value.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 5: __First-Round__ Draft Pick Trade Value</p>

Notably, the inclusion of second-round data prevents the data sets from
decreasing to zero over the span of the top 30 picks. I would say that this
first- and second-round model gives percentages that are more representative of
the truth (in comparison to using only first-round data) because we cannot
simply dismiss the value of second round picks altogether if we wish to make an
effort to evaluate realistic possibilities regarding pick swaps. Even though the
straight-up exchange of picks is not all too common (because draft trades
typically also include non-rookie players), those that do occur often include
second round picks. That is, a swap of first-round picks, even if it involves
multiple picks from one side or future first-round picks, almost never happens.

In review of the numbers in Figure 5, I am inclined to believe that those in
the second set---those using the __regressed theoretical WS IPs__---are more
realistic. In particular, the 17% relative value of the 30th pick with respect
to the top pick seems like a better estimate than the 10% estimate given by the
raw data set, which just seems too deflated.

Moreover, if I were to have included the percent values for picks 31 to 60
in Figure 5, you would observe that the numbers continue to decrease
monotonically. In light of this fact, we can deduce neither of these data sets
seems to capture the belief of NBA analytical experts that high second-round
pick represent bargains. They say that these picks, like mid-first round picks,
generate greater profit relative to their cost because there is a non-trivial
chance of selecting a relatively talented player at the top of the second round
on a team-friendly contract that does not need to abide by the rookie wage
scale.

Actually, I would have been surprised if I had seen the percentages take a
small jump around picks 30 and 31 in the WS IPs scaled with respect to the first
pick. I would only expect to see this phenomenon in the scaled __WSV__ or__
profit__ IPs because these data sets__ account for monetary returns and cost__.
In fact, this effect __DOES__ _manifest in both the scaled raw empirical and
theoretical first- and second-round profit IPs. Figure 6 shows the latter of
these two data sets. (I do not show the former because it is relatively noisy).

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-6-first-and-second-round-draft-pick-trade-value.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 6: __First- and Second-Round__ Draft Pick Trade Value</p>

Figure 6 makes it is evident that the two or three picks at the top of the
second round are more desirable (in terms of  cost efficiency) than the last
couple of picks in the first round.
^[As I indicated in a prior chapter
, the 30th value is somewhat skewed by the fact that drafts
prior to 2007 had only 29 teams. Also, the handful of values at the end
of the second round are skewed for a less obvious reason. Often, the
worst rookies in any given draft class can earn a negative amount of WS,
so the sorting of players by descending WS, as is done with the
theoretical data sets, can lead to some strange results. Moreover,
because many years have had players drafted who never ended up playing
in the NBA, there are simply not very many data points for the last
couple of draft slots.]

Finally, I can look at the value of all picks relative to one another.
Figure 7 shows the trade value of the top ten picks relative to one another in a
matrix format.
^[As a technical note, I use the regressed theoretical first-
and second-round WS IPs about which I said I believed is the most accurate data
set that I have to portray this concept.]

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-7-top-10-draft-pick-trade-value.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 7: Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value</p>

I must say that my Figure 7 is inspired by a chart shown in <a
href="http://wagesofwins.com/2013/05/21/from-the-vault-the-value-of-a-draft-pick-and-draft-pedigree-in-the-finals/">
an article</a> by <a href="http://wagesofwins.com/">Wages of Wins
</a>' writer <a href="https://twitter.com/ArturoGalletti">Arturo Galletti</a> 
meant to portray the same idea. I reproduce a cropped version of his figure below.

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/arturo-galletti-relative-draft-pick-trade-value-top-10-only.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 8: Arturo Galletti's Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value</p>

If you compare our numbers for the top 10 picks, you can see that we come
up with similar estimates. In actuality, we would come up with exactly the same
numbers if we had used precisely the same method. As I noted in a <a
href="https://numbernonsense.updog.co/questions-answers-nba-draft-pick-value/">
previous chapter</a>, Galletti simply calculates the quotient of the values
for any given two picks to come up with their relative trade value. However,
in my method, I first scale all the monetary values to a 0-to-1 unit-less
basis before taking the quotient of any given two numbers. As I note there, I
believe that my method for calculating relative values using IPs is superior
because it does not result in __negative__ values. Negative values do not
have any meaning on a relative scale of magnitude.

The fact that Galletti and I are on the same page is not too surprising
considering that we have very similar methodologies. However, our results are
fairly different from the unit-less values that can be derived from the <a
href="https://fansided.com/2016/06/16/nba-draft-trade-value-chart/">peak __value
over replacement player__ (VORP) numbers</a> of
<a href="http://nyloncalculus.com/">Nylon Calculus</a>'
<a href="https://twitter.com/nickrestifo">Nick Restifo</a>.
(In case you missed it, I mentioned both Galletti's and Restifo's
results on this topic in a previous chapter.

After translating Restifo's peak VORP numbers to IPs, I can put his
trade value numbers on equal ground with mine and those of Galletti. Figure 8
presents the results.

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-nick-restifo-top-10-draft-pick-trade-value-ip.jpg)
<p id="fig_label">Figure 9: Nick Restifo's Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value</p>

Clearly, his numbers deviate fairly significantly from mine and 
Galletti's. This trend becomes even more extreme as the pick number 
increase beyond 10. However, as I discussed in that previous chapter, it is 
not really fair to compare the chart that can be derived from Galletti's 
regressed "Net Actual Value" numbers (which are equivalent to my profit 
numbers translated to IPs and generate the exact same chart as the one I 
present in my Figure 7) and the chart that I derive from Restifo's 
estimates. Mine and Galletti's discount basketball production with cost, 
while Restifo's measure basketball production only. Nevertheless, even 
after I account for the cost factor to put Galletti's and Restifo's 
numbers on the same basis, the relative trade value numbers still 
differ noticeably. Figure 9 shows Galletti's basketball-production-only 
numbers that reflect the same idea as Restifo's normalized values in 
Figure 8. 

![](images/nba-draft-pick-value-indifferent-probability-2/figure-arturo-galleti-top-10-draft-pick-trade-value-avg-wins-ip.jpg")
<p id="fig_label"> Figure 10: Arturo Galletti's Top 10 Draft Pick Trade Value (__Neglecting__ Cost)</p> 

The answer to the question of whose numbers are more accurate depend on 
your preference for basketball-production evaluation. Galletti and I use 
average empirical four-year [__wins produced__](http://wagesofwins.com/wins-produced/) (WP) 
and [__win shares__](http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html") (WS) 
respectively for our on-court value measurements, 
while Restifo employs best two-year VORP. 

So, how much should teams be willing to trade for draft picks (in terms 
of other draft picks)? Unfortunately, my best answer is "it depends". 
Anyways, there are so many other factors that can inflate or deflate 
trade values---such as a team's current cap situation, the number of 
picks that it holds in the given year's draft or in future drafts, 
etc.--that this question would be difficult to answer definitively 
without being very specific in its statement. For example, it would 
probably be better to ask something like "Given that the Boston Celtics 
have three first-round picks and three second-round picks in this draft, 
six more second-round picks in the next two drafts, and enough cap room 
to fit two maximum salary players on their roster, should they offer the 
Sacramento Kings a deal including their top three picks from this 
draft, as well as all of their second-round picks in the next two 
years, in return for DeMarcus Cousins?" Of course, even if I were to try 
to answer a question like this, whatever conclusion I come up with would 
be difficult to generalize. 

Nevertheless, I plan to look at a case study of a
draft-day trade in an attempt to make my draft pick value estimates more
tangible.
